36,No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth,The War of the Worlds,24
36,century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by,The War of the Worlds,25
36,intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as,The War of the Worlds,26
36,men busied themselves about their various concerns they were,The War of the Worlds,27
36,"scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a",The War of the Worlds,28
36,microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and,The War of the Worlds,29
36,multiply in a drop of water.  With infinite complacency men went to,The War of the Worlds,30
36,"and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their",The War of the Worlds,31
36,assurance of their empire over matter.  It is possible that the,The War of the Worlds,32
36,infusoria under the microscope do the same.  No one gave a thought to,The War of the Worlds,33
36,"the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of",The War of the Worlds,34
36,them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or,The War of the Worlds,35
36,improbable.  It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of,The War of the Worlds,36
36,those departed days.  At most terrestrial men fancied there might be,The War of the Worlds,37
36,"other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to",The War of the Worlds,38
36,"welcome a missionary enterprise.  Yet across the gulf of space, minds",The War of the Worlds,39
36,"that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish,",The War of the Worlds,40
36,"intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with",The War of the Worlds,41
36,"envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.  And",The War of the Worlds,42
36,early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.,The War of the Worlds,43
36,"",The War of the Worlds,44
36,"The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the",The War of the Worlds,45
36,"sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it",The War of the Worlds,46
36,receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world.,The War of the Worlds,47
36,"It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our",The War of the Worlds,48
36,"world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its",The War of the Worlds,49
36,surface must have begun its course.  The fact that it is scarcely one,The War of the Worlds,50
36,seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling,The War of the Worlds,51
36,to the temperature at which life could begin.  It has air and water,The War of the Worlds,52
36,and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.,The War of the Worlds,53
36,"",The War of the Worlds,54
36,"Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer,",The War of the Worlds,55
36,"up to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that",The War of the Worlds,56
36,"intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,",The War of the Worlds,57
36,beyond its earthly level.  Nor was it generally understood that since,The War of the Worlds,58
36,"Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the",The War of the Worlds,59
36,"superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that",The War of the Worlds,60
36,it is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end.,The War of the Worlds,61
36,"",The War of the Worlds,62
36,The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has,The War of the Worlds,63
36,already gone far indeed with our neighbour.  Its physical condition is,The War of the Worlds,64
36,"still largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial",The War of the Worlds,65
36,region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest,The War of the Worlds,66
36,"winter.  Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have",The War of the Worlds,67
36,"shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow",The War of the Worlds,68
36,seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and,The War of the Worlds,69
36,periodically inundate its temperate zones.  That last stage of,The War of the Worlds,70
36,"exhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has become a",The War of the Worlds,71
36,present-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars.  The immediate,The War of the Worlds,72
36,"pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their",The War of the Worlds,73
36,"powers, and hardened their hearts.  And looking across space with",The War of the Worlds,74
36,"instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of,",The War of the Worlds,75
36,"they see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of",The War of the Worlds,76
36,"them, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with",The War of the Worlds,77
36,"vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of",The War of the Worlds,78
36,"fertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad",The War of the Worlds,79
36,"stretches of populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas.",The War of the Worlds,80
36,"",The War of the Worlds,81
36,"And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them",The War of the Worlds,82
36,at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us.  The,The War of the Worlds,83
36,intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant,The War of the Worlds,84
36,"struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief",The War of the Worlds,85
36,of the minds upon Mars.  Their world is far gone in its cooling and,The War of the Worlds,86
36,"this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they",The War of the Worlds,87
36,"regard as inferior animals.  To carry warfare sunward is, indeed,",The War of the Worlds,88
36,"their only escape from the destruction that, generation after",The War of the Worlds,89
36,"generation, creeps upon them.",The War of the Worlds,90
36,"",The War of the Worlds,91
36,And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what,The War of the Worlds,92
36,"ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only",The War of the Worlds,93
36,"upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its",The War of the Worlds,94
36,"inferior races.  The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness,",The War of the Worlds,95
36,were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged,The War of the Worlds,96
36,"by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years.  Are we such",The War of the Worlds,97
36,apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same,The War of the Worlds,98
36,spirit?,The War of the Worlds,99
36,"",The War of the Worlds,100
36,The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing,The War of the Worlds,101
36,subtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of,The War of the Worlds,102
36,ours--and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh,The War of the Worlds,103
36,"perfect unanimity.  Had our instruments permitted it, we might have",The War of the Worlds,104
36,seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century.  Men,The War of the Worlds,105
36,"like Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, that",The War of the Worlds,106
36,for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to,The War of the Worlds,107
36,interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so,The War of the Worlds,108
36,well.  All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.,The War of the Worlds,109
36,"",The War of the Worlds,110
36,During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the,The War of the Worlds,111
36,"illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by",The War of the Worlds,112
36,"Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.  English readers heard",The War of the Worlds,113
36,of it first in the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2.  I am inclined to,The War of the Worlds,114
36,"think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in",The War of the Worlds,115
36,"the vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shots were fired",The War of the Worlds,116
36,"at us.  Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site",The War of the Worlds,117
36,of that outbreak during the next two oppositions.,The War of the Worlds,118
36,"",The War of the Worlds,119
36,The storm burst upon us six years ago now.  As Mars approached,The War of the Worlds,120
36,"opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange",The War of the Worlds,121
36,palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of,The War of the Worlds,122
36,incandescent gas upon the planet.  It had occurred towards midnight of,The War of the Worlds,123
36,"the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,",The War of the Worlds,124
36,"indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an",The War of the Worlds,125
36,enormous velocity towards this earth.  This jet of fire had become,The War of the Worlds,126
36,invisible about a quarter past twelve.  He compared it to a colossal,The War of the Worlds,127
36,"puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, ""as",The War of the Worlds,128
36,"flaming gases rushed out of a gun.""",The War of the Worlds,129
36,"",The War of the Worlds,130
36,A singularly appropriate phrase it proved.  Yet the next day there,The War of the Worlds,131
36,was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily,The War of the Worlds,132
36,"Telegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest",The War of the Worlds,133
36,dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of,The War of the Worlds,134
36,"the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer,",The War of the Worlds,135
36,"at Ottershaw.  He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess",The War of the Worlds,136
36,of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a,The War of the Worlds,137
36,scrutiny of the red planet.,The War of the Worlds,138
36,"",The War of the Worlds,139
36,"In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that",The War of the Worlds,140
36,"vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed",The War of the Worlds,141
36,"lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the",The War of the Worlds,142
36,"steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in",The War of the Worlds,143
36,the roof--an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it.,The War of the Worlds,144
36,"Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible.  Looking through the",The War of the Worlds,145
36,"telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet",The War of the Worlds,146
36,"swimming in the field.  It seemed such a little thing, so bright and",The War of the Worlds,147
36,"small and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly",The War of the Worlds,148
36,"flattened from the perfect round.  But so little it was, so silvery",The War of the Worlds,149
36,"warm--a pin's-head of light! It was as if it quivered, but really this",The War of the Worlds,150
36,was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that,The War of the Worlds,151
36,kept the planet in view.,The War of the Worlds,152
36,"",The War of the Worlds,153
36,"As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to",The War of the Worlds,154
36,"advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired.  Forty",The War of the Worlds,155
36,millions of miles it was from us--more than forty millions of miles of,The War of the Worlds,156
36,void.  Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust,The War of the Worlds,157
36,of the material universe swims.,The War of the Worlds,158
36,"",The War of the Worlds,159
36,"Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,",The War of the Worlds,160
36,"three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the",The War of the Worlds,161
36,unfathomable darkness of empty space.  You know how that blackness,The War of the Worlds,162
36,looks on a frosty starlight night.  In a telescope it seems far,The War of the Worlds,163
36,"profounder.  And invisible to me because it was so remote and small,",The War of the Worlds,164
36,flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible,The War of the Worlds,165
36,"distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles,",The War of the Worlds,166
36,"came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so",The War of the Worlds,167
36,much struggle and calamity and death to the earth.  I never dreamed of,The War of the Worlds,168
36,it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring,The War of the Worlds,169
36,missile.,The War of the Worlds,170
36,"",The War of the Worlds,171
36,"That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the",The War of the Worlds,172
36,"distant planet.  I saw it.  A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest",The War of the Worlds,173
36,projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and,The War of the Worlds,174
36,at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place.  The night was warm and I,The War of the Worlds,175
36,"was thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way",The War of the Worlds,176
36,"in the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while",The War of the Worlds,177
36,Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.,The War of the Worlds,178
36,"",The War of the Worlds,179
36,That night another invisible missile started on its way to the,The War of the Worlds,180
36,"earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the",The War of the Worlds,181
36,"first one.  I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness,",The War of the Worlds,182
36,with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes.  I wished I,The War of the Worlds,183
36,"had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute",The War of the Worlds,184
36,gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me.  Ogilvy,The War of the Worlds,185
36,"watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and",The War of the Worlds,186
36,walked over to his house.  Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw,The War of the Worlds,187
36,"and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.",The War of the Worlds,188
36,"",The War of the Worlds,189
36,"He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars,",The War of the Worlds,190
36,and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were,The War of the Worlds,191
36,signalling us.  His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a,The War of the Worlds,192
36,"heavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in",The War of the Worlds,193
36,progress.  He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic,The War of the Worlds,194
36,evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.,The War of the Worlds,195
36,"",The War of the Worlds,196
36,"""The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to",The War of the Worlds,197
36,"one,"" he said.",The War of the Worlds,198
36,"",The War of the Worlds,199
36,Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after,The War of the Worlds,200
36,"about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a",The War of the Worlds,201
36,flame each night.  Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on,The War of the Worlds,202
36,earth has attempted to explain.  It may be the gases of the firing,The War of the Worlds,203
36,"caused the Martians inconvenience.  Dense clouds of smoke or dust,",The War of the Worlds,204
36,"visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey,",The War of the Worlds,205
36,"fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planet's",The War of the Worlds,206
36,atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features.,The War of the Worlds,207
36,"",The War of the Worlds,208
36,"Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and",The War of the Worlds,209
36,"popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the",The War of the Worlds,210
36,"volcanoes upon Mars.  The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember,",The War of the Worlds,211
36,"made a happy use of it in the political cartoon.  And, all",The War of the Worlds,212
36,"unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew",The War of the Worlds,213
36,"earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the",The War of the Worlds,214
36,"empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer.",The War of the Worlds,215
36,"It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift",The War of the Worlds,216
36,"fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they",The War of the Worlds,217
36,did.  I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph,The War of the Worlds,218
36,of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days.,The War of the Worlds,219
36,People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and,The War of the Worlds,220
36,"enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers.  For my own part, I was",The War of the Worlds,221
36,"much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series",The War of the Worlds,222
36,of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as,The War of the Worlds,223
36,civilisation progressed.,The War of the Worlds,224
36,"",The War of the Worlds,225
36,One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been,The War of the Worlds,226
36,"10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.  It was",The War of the Worlds,227
36,"starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed",The War of the Worlds,228
36,"out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so",The War of the Worlds,229
36,"many telescopes were pointed.  It was a warm night.  Coming home, a",The War of the Worlds,230
36,party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing,The War of the Worlds,231
36,and playing music.  There were lights in the upper windows of the,The War of the Worlds,232
36,houses as the people went to bed.  From the railway station in the,The War of the Worlds,233
36,"distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling,",The War of the Worlds,234
36,softened almost into melody by the distance.  My wife pointed out to,The War of the Worlds,235
36,"me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging",The War of the Worlds,236
36,in a framework against the sky.  It seemed so safe and tranquil.,The War of the Worlds,237
36,"",The War of the Worlds,238
36,"",The War of the Worlds,239
36,"",The War of the Worlds,240
36,CHAPTER TWO,The War of the Worlds,241

36,THE FALLING STAR,The War of the Worlds,243
36,"",The War of the Worlds,244
36,"",The War of the Worlds,245
36,Then came the night of the first falling star.  It was seen early,The War of the Worlds,246
36,"in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high",The War of the Worlds,247
36,"in the atmosphere.  Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an",The War of the Worlds,248
36,ordinary falling star.  Albin described it as leaving a greenish,The War of the Worlds,249
36,"streak behind it that glowed for some seconds.  Denning, our greatest",The War of the Worlds,250
36,"authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first",The War of the Worlds,251
36,appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.  It seemed to him,The War of the Worlds,252
36,that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.,The War of the Worlds,253
36,"",The War of the Worlds,254
36,I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my,The War of the Worlds,255
36,French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I,The War of the Worlds,256
36,"loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it.",The War of the Worlds,257
36,Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer,The War of the Worlds,258
36,"space must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I",The War of the Worlds,259
36,only looked up as it passed.  Some of those who saw its flight say it,The War of the Worlds,260
36,travelled with a hissing sound.  I myself heard nothing of that.  Many,The War of the Worlds,261
36,"people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of",The War of the Worlds,262
36,"it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended.",The War of the Worlds,263
36,No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.,The War of the Worlds,264
36,"",The War of the Worlds,265
36,"But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the",The War of the Worlds,266
36,shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on,The War of the Worlds,267
36,"the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the",The War of the Worlds,268
36,"idea of finding it.  Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from",The War of the Worlds,269
36,the sand pits.  An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the,The War of the Worlds,270
36,"projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every",The War of the Worlds,271
36,"direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half",The War of the Worlds,272
36,"away.  The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose",The War of the Worlds,273
36,against the dawn.,The War of the Worlds,274
36,"",The War of the Worlds,275
36,"The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the",The War of the Worlds,276
36,scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its,The War of the Worlds,277
36,"descent.  The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,",The War of the Worlds,278
36,caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured,The War of the Worlds,279
36,incrustation.  It had a diameter of about thirty yards.  He approached,The War of the Worlds,280
36,"the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most",The War of the Worlds,281
36,"meteorites are rounded more or less completely.  It was, however,",The War of the Worlds,282
36,still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near,The War of the Worlds,283
36,approach.  A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the,The War of the Worlds,284
36,unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred,The War of the Worlds,285
36,to him that it might be hollow.,The War of the Worlds,286
36,"",The War of the Worlds,287
36,He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made,The War of the Worlds,288
36,"for itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at",The War of the Worlds,289
36,"its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some",The War of the Worlds,290
36,evidence of design in its arrival.  The early morning was wonderfully,The War of the Worlds,291
36,"still, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge,",The War of the Worlds,292
36,"was already warm.  He did not remember hearing any birds that morning,",The War of the Worlds,293
36,"there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the",The War of the Worlds,294
36,faint movements from within the cindery cylinder.  He was all alone on,The War of the Worlds,295
36,the common.,The War of the Worlds,296
36,"",The War of the Worlds,297
36,Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey,The War of the Worlds,298
36,"clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling",The War of the Worlds,299
36,off the circular edge of the end.  It was dropping off in flakes and,The War of the Worlds,300
36,raining down upon the sand.  A large piece suddenly came off and fell,The War of the Worlds,301
36,with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.,The War of the Worlds,302
36,"",The War of the Worlds,303
36,"For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although",The War of the Worlds,304
36,"the heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the",The War of the Worlds,305
36,bulk to see the Thing more clearly.  He fancied even then that the,The War of the Worlds,306
36,"cooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed that",The War of the Worlds,307
36,idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the,The War of the Worlds,308
36,cylinder.,The War of the Worlds,309
36,"",The War of the Worlds,310
36,"And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the",The War of the Worlds,311
36,cylinder was rotating on its body.  It was such a gradual movement,The War of the Worlds,312
36,that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had,The War of the Worlds,313
36,been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the,The War of the Worlds,314
36,"circumference.  Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,",The War of the Worlds,315
36,until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk,The War of the Worlds,316
36,forward an inch or so.  Then the thing came upon him in a flash.  The,The War of the Worlds,317
36,cylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed out!,The War of the Worlds,318
36,Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!,The War of the Worlds,319
36,"",The War of the Worlds,320
36,"""Good heavens!"" said Ogilvy.  ""There's a man in it--men in it! Half",The War of the Worlds,321
36,"roasted to death!  Trying to escape!""",The War of the Worlds,322
36,"",The War of the Worlds,323
36,"At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the",The War of the Worlds,324
36,flash upon Mars.,The War of the Worlds,325
36,"",The War of the Worlds,326
36,The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he,The War of the Worlds,327
36,forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn.  But,The War of the Worlds,328
36,luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands,The War of the Worlds,329
36,"on the still-glowing metal.  At that he stood irresolute for a moment,",The War of the Worlds,330
36,"then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into",The War of the Worlds,331
36,Woking.  The time then must have been somewhere about six o'clock.,The War of the Worlds,332
36,"He met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he",The War of the Worlds,333
36,told and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen off in the,The War of the Worlds,334
36,pit--that the man simply drove on.  He was equally unsuccessful with the,The War of the Worlds,335
36,potman who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell,The War of the Worlds,336
36,Bridge.  The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an,The War of the Worlds,337
36,unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom.  That sobered him a,The War of the Worlds,338
36,"little; and when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his",The War of the Worlds,339
36,"garden, he called over the palings and made himself understood.",The War of the Worlds,340
36,"",The War of the Worlds,341
36,"""Henderson,"" he called, ""you saw that shooting star last night?""",The War of the Worlds,342
36,"",The War of the Worlds,343
36,"""Well?"" said Henderson.",The War of the Worlds,344
36,"",The War of the Worlds,345
36,"""It's out on Horsell Common now.""",The War of the Worlds,346
36,"",The War of the Worlds,347
36,"""Good Lord!"" said Henderson.  ""Fallen meteorite!  That's good.""",The War of the Worlds,348
36,"",The War of the Worlds,349
36,"""But it's something more than a meteorite.  It's a cylinder--an",The War of the Worlds,350
36,"artificial cylinder, man!  And there's something inside.""",The War of the Worlds,351
36,"",The War of the Worlds,352
36,Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.,The War of the Worlds,353
36,"",The War of the Worlds,354
36,"""What's that?"" he said.  He was deaf in one ear.",The War of the Worlds,355
36,"",The War of the Worlds,356
36,Ogilvy told him all that he had seen.  Henderson was a minute or so,The War of the Worlds,357
36,"taking it in.  Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and",The War of the Worlds,358
36,came out into the road.  The two men hurried back at once to the,The War of the Worlds,359
36,"common, and found the cylinder still lying in the same position.  But",The War of the Worlds,360
36,"now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal",The War of the Worlds,361
36,showed between the top and the body of the cylinder.  Air was either,The War of the Worlds,362
36,"entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.",The War of the Worlds,363
36,"",The War of the Worlds,364
36,"They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,",The War of the Worlds,365
36,"meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside",The War of the Worlds,366
36,must be insensible or dead.,The War of the Worlds,367
36,"",The War of the Worlds,368
36,Of course the two were quite unable to do anything.  They shouted,The War of the Worlds,369
36,"consolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get",The War of the Worlds,370
36,"help.  One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and",The War of the Worlds,371
36,"disordered, running up the little street in the bright sunlight just",The War of the Worlds,372
36,as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were,The War of the Worlds,373
36,opening their bedroom windows.  Henderson went into the railway,The War of the Worlds,374
36,"station at once, in order to telegraph the news to London.  The",The War of the Worlds,375
36,newspaper articles had prepared men's minds for the reception of the,The War of the Worlds,376
36,idea.,The War of the Worlds,377
36,"",The War of the Worlds,378
36,By eight o'clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already,The War of the Worlds,379
36,"started for the common to see the ""dead men from Mars.""  That was the",The War of the Worlds,380
36,form the story took.  I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about,The War of the Worlds,381
36,a quarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_.  I was,The War of the Worlds,382
36,"naturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the",The War of the Worlds,383
36,Ottershaw bridge to the sand pits.,The War of the Worlds,384

36,ON HORSELL COMMON,The War of the Worlds,390
36,"",The War of the Worlds,391
36,"",The War of the Worlds,392
36,I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the,The War of the Worlds,393
36,huge hole in which the cylinder lay.  I have already described the,The War of the Worlds,394
36,"appearance of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground.  The turf",The War of the Worlds,395
36,and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion.  No,The War of the Worlds,396
36,doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire.  Henderson and Ogilvy,The War of the Worlds,397
36,were not there.  I think they perceived that nothing was to be done,The War of the Worlds,398
36,"for the present, and had gone away to breakfast at Henderson's house.",The War of the Worlds,399
36,"",The War of the Worlds,400
36,"There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with",The War of the Worlds,401
36,"their feet dangling, and amusing themselves--until I stopped them--by",The War of the Worlds,402
36,throwing stones at the giant mass.  After I had spoken to them about,The War of the Worlds,403
36,"it, they began playing at ""touch"" in and out of the group of",The War of the Worlds,404
36,bystanders.,The War of the Worlds,405
36,"",The War of the Worlds,406
36,"Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I",The War of the Worlds,407
36,"employed sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his",The War of the Worlds,408
36,"little boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were",The War of the Worlds,409
36,accustomed to hang about the railway station.  There was very little,The War of the Worlds,410
36,talking.  Few of the common people in England had anything but the,The War of the Worlds,411
36,vaguest astronomical ideas in those days.  Most of them were staring,The War of the Worlds,412
36,"quietly at the big table like end of the cylinder, which was still as",The War of the Worlds,413
36,Ogilvy and Henderson had left it.  I fancy the popular expectation of,The War of the Worlds,414
36,a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk.,The War of the Worlds,415
36,"Some went away while I was there, and other people came.  I clambered",The War of the Worlds,416
36,into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet.  The,The War of the Worlds,417
36,top had certainly ceased to rotate.,The War of the Worlds,418
36,"",The War of the Worlds,419
36,It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of,The War of the Worlds,420
36,this object was at all evident to me.  At the first glance it was,The War of the Worlds,421
36,really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown,The War of the Worlds,422
36,"across the road.  Not so much so, indeed.  It looked like a rusty gas",The War of the Worlds,423
36,float.  It required a certain amount of scientific education to,The War of the Worlds,424
36,"perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that",The War of the Worlds,425
36,the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid,The War of the Worlds,426
36,"and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue.  ""Extra-terrestrial"" had no",The War of the Worlds,427
36,meaning for most of the onlookers.,The War of the Worlds,428
36,"",The War of the Worlds,429
36,At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had,The War of the Worlds,430
36,"come from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it",The War of the Worlds,431
36,contained any living creature.  I thought the unscrewing might be,The War of the Worlds,432
36,"automatic.  In spite of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men",The War of the Worlds,433
36,in Mars.  My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its,The War of the Worlds,434
36,"containing manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that might",The War of the Worlds,435
36,"arise, whether we should find coins and models in it, and so forth.",The War of the Worlds,436
36,Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea.  I felt an,The War of the Worlds,437
36,"impatience to see it opened.  About eleven, as nothing seemed",The War of the Worlds,438
36,"happening, I walked back, full of such thought, to my home in Maybury.",The War of the Worlds,439
36,But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract,The War of the Worlds,440
36,investigations.,The War of the Worlds,441
36,"",The War of the Worlds,442
36,In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very,The War of the Worlds,443
36,much.  The early editions of the evening papers had startled London,The War of the Worlds,444
36,with enormous headlines:,The War of the Worlds,445
36,"",The War of the Worlds,446
36,"  ""A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.""",The War of the Worlds,447
36,"",The War of the Worlds,448
36,"  ""REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,""",The War of the Worlds,449
36,"",The War of the Worlds,450
36,"and so forth.  In addition, Ogilvy's wire to the Astronomical Exchange",The War of the Worlds,451
36,had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.,The War of the Worlds,452
36,"",The War of the Worlds,453
36,There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking station,The War of the Worlds,454
36,"standing in the road by the sand pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham,",The War of the Worlds,455
36,"and a rather lordly carriage.  Besides that, there was quite a heap of",The War of the Worlds,456
36,"bicycles.  In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in",The War of the Worlds,457
36,"spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there",The War of the Worlds,458
36,was altogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily dressed,The War of the Worlds,459
36,ladies among the others.,The War of the Worlds,460
36,"",The War of the Worlds,461
36,"It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind,",The War of the Worlds,462
36,and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees.  The,The War of the Worlds,463
36,"burning heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards",The War of the Worlds,464
36,"Ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off",The War of the Worlds,465
36,vertical streamers of smoke.  An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in,The War of the Worlds,466
36,the Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green,The War of the Worlds,467
36,apples and ginger beer.,The War of the Worlds,468
36,"",The War of the Worlds,469
36,"Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of",The War of the Worlds,470
36,"about half a dozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man",The War of the Worlds,471
36,"that I afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with",The War of the Worlds,472
36,several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes.  Stent was giving,The War of the Worlds,473
36,"directions in a clear, high-pitched voice.  He was standing on the",The War of the Worlds,474
36,"cylinder, which was now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson",The War of the Worlds,475
36,"and streaming with perspiration, and something seemed to have",The War of the Worlds,476
36,irritated him.,The War of the Worlds,477
36,"",The War of the Worlds,478
36,"A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its",The War of the Worlds,479
36,lower end was still embedded.  As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the,The War of the Worlds,480
36,"staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and",The War of the Worlds,481
36,"asked me if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of",The War of the Worlds,482
36,the manor.,The War of the Worlds,483
36,"",The War of the Worlds,484
36,"The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to",The War of the Worlds,485
36,"their excavations, especially the boys.  They wanted a light railing",The War of the Worlds,486
36,"put up, and help to keep the people back.  He told me that a faint",The War of the Worlds,487
36,"stirring was occasionally still audible within the case, but that the",The War of the Worlds,488
36,"workmen had failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them.",The War of the Worlds,489
36,"The case appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the",The War of the Worlds,490
36,faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.,The War of the Worlds,491
36,"",The War of the Worlds,492
36,"I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the",The War of the Worlds,493
36,privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure.  I failed to,The War of the Worlds,494
36,"find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from",The War of the Worlds,495
36,London by the six o'clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then,The War of the Worlds,496
36,"about a quarter past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to",The War of the Worlds,497
36,the station to waylay him.,The War of the Worlds,498

36,"",The War of the Worlds,505
36,"",The War of the Worlds,506
36,When I returned to the common the sun was setting.  Scattered groups,The War of the Worlds,507
36,"were hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons",The War of the Worlds,508
36,"were returning.  The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out",The War of the Worlds,509
36,"black against the lemon yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people,",The War of the Worlds,510
36,"perhaps.  There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared",The War of the Worlds,511
36,to be going on about the pit.  Strange imaginings passed through my,The War of the Worlds,512
36,mind.  As I drew nearer I heard Stent's voice:,The War of the Worlds,513
36,"",The War of the Worlds,514
36,"""Keep back!  Keep back!""",The War of the Worlds,515

36,"",The War of the Worlds,521
36,"I went on to the crowd.  There were really, I should think, two or",The War of the Worlds,522
36,"three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two",The War of the Worlds,523
36,ladies there being by no means the least active.,The War of the Worlds,524
36,"",The War of the Worlds,525
36,"""He's fallen in the pit!"" cried some one.",The War of the Worlds,526
36,"",The War of the Worlds,527
36,"""Keep back!"" said several.",The War of the Worlds,528
36,"",The War of the Worlds,529
36,"The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.  Every one",The War of the Worlds,530
36,seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar humming sound from the,The War of the Worlds,531
36,pit.,The War of the Worlds,532
36,"",The War of the Worlds,533
36,"""I say!"" said Ogilvy; ""help keep these idiots back.  We don't know",The War of the Worlds,534
36,"what's in the confounded thing, you know!""",The War of the Worlds,535
36,"",The War of the Worlds,536
36,"I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,",The War of the Worlds,537
36,standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again.,The War of the Worlds,538
36,The crowd had pushed him in.,The War of the Worlds,539
36,"",The War of the Worlds,540
36,The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within.  Nearly,The War of the Worlds,541
36,"two feet of shining screw projected.  Somebody blundered against me,",The War of the Worlds,542
36,and I narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw.  I,The War of the Worlds,543
36,"turned, and as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of",The War of the Worlds,544
36,the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion.  I stuck,The War of the Worlds,545
36,"my elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the",The War of the Worlds,546
36,Thing again.  For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black.,The War of the Worlds,547
36,I had the sunset in my eyes.,The War of the Worlds,548
36,"",The War of the Worlds,549
36,I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something a,The War of the Worlds,550
36,"little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man.  I know",The War of the Worlds,551
36,"I did.  But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the",The War of the Worlds,552
36,"shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two",The War of the Worlds,553
36,luminous disks--like eyes.  Then something resembling a little grey,The War of the Worlds,554
36,"snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the",The War of the Worlds,555
36,"writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another.",The War of the Worlds,556
36,"",The War of the Worlds,557
36,A sudden chill came over me.  There was a loud shriek from a woman,The War of the Worlds,558
36,"behind.  I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,",The War of the Worlds,559
36,"from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my",The War of the Worlds,560
36,way back from the edge of the pit.  I saw astonishment giving place to,The War of the Worlds,561
36,horror on the faces of the people about me.  I heard inarticulate,The War of the Worlds,562
36,exclamations on all sides.  There was a general movement backwards.,The War of the Worlds,563
36,I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit.  I found,The War of the Worlds,564
36,"myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running",The War of the Worlds,565
36,"off, Stent among them.  I looked again at the cylinder, and",The War of the Worlds,566
36,ungovernable terror gripped me.  I stood petrified and staring.,The War of the Worlds,567
36,"",The War of the Worlds,568
36,"A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was",The War of the Worlds,569
36,rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder.  As it bulged up and,The War of the Worlds,570
36,"caught the light, it glistened like wet leather.",The War of the Worlds,571
36,"",The War of the Worlds,572
36,Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly.  The,The War of the Worlds,573
36,"mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had,",The War of the Worlds,574
36,"one might say, a face.  There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless",The War of the Worlds,575
36,"brim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva.  The whole",The War of the Worlds,576
36,creature heaved and pulsated convulsively.  A lank tentacular,The War of the Worlds,577
36,"appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.",The War of the Worlds,578
36,"",The War of the Worlds,579
36,Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the,The War of the Worlds,580

36,"its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a",The War of the Worlds,582
36,"chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this",The War of the Worlds,583
36,"mouth, the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the",The War of the Worlds,584
36,"lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness",The War of the Worlds,585
36,of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth--above,The War of the Worlds,586
36,"all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes--were at",The War of the Worlds,587
36,"once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous.  There was",The War of the Worlds,588
36,"something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy",The War of the Worlds,589
36,deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty.  Even at this,The War of the Worlds,590
36,"first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and",The War of the Worlds,591
36,dread.,The War of the Worlds,592
36,"",The War of the Worlds,593
36,Suddenly the monster vanished.  It had toppled over the brim of the,The War of the Worlds,594
36,"cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great",The War of the Worlds,595
36,"mass of leather.  I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith",The War of the Worlds,596
36,another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the,The War of the Worlds,597
36,aperture.,The War of the Worlds,598
36,"",The War of the Worlds,599
36,"I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees,",The War of the Worlds,600
36,"perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for",The War of the Worlds,601
36,I could not avert my face from these things.,The War of the Worlds,602
36,"",The War of the Worlds,603
36,"There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped,",The War of the Worlds,604
36,"panting, and waited further developments.  The common round the sand",The War of the Worlds,605
36,"pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a half-fascinated",The War of the Worlds,606
36,"terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the heaped gravel at",The War of the Worlds,607
36,"the edge of the pit in which they lay.  And then, with a renewed",The War of the Worlds,608
36,"horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on the edge of",The War of the Worlds,609
36,"the pit.  It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, but",The War of the Worlds,610
36,showing as a little black object against the hot western sun.  Now he,The War of the Worlds,611
36,"got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until",The War of the Worlds,612
36,"only his head was visible.  Suddenly he vanished, and I could have",The War of the Worlds,613
36,fancied a faint shriek had reached me.  I had a momentary impulse to,The War of the Worlds,614
36,go back and help him that my fears overruled.,The War of the Worlds,615
36,"",The War of the Worlds,616
36,"Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the",The War of the Worlds,617
36,heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made.  Anyone coming,The War of the Worlds,618
36,along the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the,The War of the Worlds,619
36,sight--a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more,The War of the Worlds,620
36,"standing in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes,",The War of the Worlds,621
36,"behind gates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in",The War of the Worlds,622
36,"short, excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of",The War of the Worlds,623
36,"sand.  The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black",The War of the Worlds,624
36,"against the burning sky, and in the sand pits was a row of deserted",The War of the Worlds,625
36,vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the,The War of the Worlds,626
36,ground.,The War of the Worlds,627

36,"",The War of the Worlds,635
36,After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the,The War of the Worlds,636
36,"cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind",The War of the Worlds,637
36,of fascination paralysed my actions.  I remained standing knee-deep in,The War of the Worlds,638
36,"the heather, staring at the mound that hid them.  I was a battleground",The War of the Worlds,639
36,of fear and curiosity.,The War of the Worlds,640
36,"",The War of the Worlds,641
36,"I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate",The War of the Worlds,642
36,"longing to peer into it.  I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,",The War of the Worlds,643
36,seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand,The War of the Worlds,644
36,heaps that hid these new-comers to our earth.  Once a leash of thin,The War of the Worlds,645
36,"black whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset",The War of the Worlds,646
36,"and was immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up,",The War of the Worlds,647
36,"joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a",The War of the Worlds,648
36,wobbling motion.  What could be going on there?,The War of the Worlds,649
36,"",The War of the Worlds,650
36,Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups--one a,The War of the Worlds,651
36,"little crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the",The War of the Worlds,652
36,direction of Chobham.  Evidently they shared my mental conflict.,The War of the Worlds,653
36,"There were few near me.  One man I approached--he was, I perceived,",The War of the Worlds,654
36,"a neighbour of mine, though I did not know his name--and accosted.",The War of the Worlds,655
36,But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation.,The War of the Worlds,656
36,"",The War of the Worlds,657
36,"""What ugly _brutes_!"" he said.  ""Good God!  What ugly brutes!""  He",The War of the Worlds,658
36,repeated this over and over again.,The War of the Worlds,659
36,"",The War of the Worlds,660
36,"""Did you see a man in the pit?"" I said; but he made no answer to",The War of the Worlds,661
36,"that.  We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side,",The War of the Worlds,662
36,"deriving, I fancy, a certain comfort in one another's company.  Then I",The War of the Worlds,663
36,shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a,The War of the Worlds,664
36,yard or more of elevation and when I looked for him presently he was,The War of the Worlds,665
36,walking towards Woking.,The War of the Worlds,666
36,"",The War of the Worlds,667
36,The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The,The War of the Worlds,668
36,"crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I",The War of the Worlds,669
36,heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards,The War of the Worlds,670
36,Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from,The War of the Worlds,671
36,the pit.,The War of the Worlds,672
36,"",The War of the Worlds,673
36,"It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I",The War of the Worlds,674
36,suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore,The War of the Worlds,675
36,"confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent",The War of the Worlds,676
36,"movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather",The War of the Worlds,677
36,force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained,The War of the Worlds,678
36,"unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance,",The War of the Worlds,679
36,"stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin",The War of the Worlds,680
36,irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated,The War of the Worlds,681
36,"horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.",The War of the Worlds,682
36,"",The War of the Worlds,683
36,Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand,The War of the Worlds,684
36,"pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a",The War of the Worlds,685
36,"lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards",The War of the Worlds,686
36,"of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little",The War of the Worlds,687
36,"black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.",The War of the Worlds,688
36,"",The War of the Worlds,689
36,"This was the Deputation.  There had been a hasty consultation, and",The War of the Worlds,690
36,"since the Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,",The War of the Worlds,691
36,"intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by",The War of the Worlds,692
36,"approaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.",The War of the Worlds,693
36,"",The War of the Worlds,694
36,"Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the",The War of the Worlds,695
36,"left.  It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards",The War of the Worlds,696
36,"I learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this",The War of the Worlds,697
36,attempt at communication.  This little group had in its advance,The War of the Worlds,698
36,"dragged inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost",The War of the Worlds,699
36,"complete circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed",The War of the Worlds,700
36,it at discreet distances.,The War of the Worlds,701
36,"",The War of the Worlds,702
36,"Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous",The War of the Worlds,703
36,"greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which",The War of the Worlds,704
36,"drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air.",The War of the Worlds,705
36,"",The War of the Worlds,706
36,"This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was",The War of the Worlds,707
36,so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of,The War of the Worlds,708
36,"brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to",The War of the Worlds,709
36,"darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after",The War of the Worlds,710
36,their dispersal.  At the same time a faint hissing sound became,The War of the Worlds,711
36,audible.,The War of the Worlds,712
36,"",The War of the Worlds,713
36,Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag,The War of the Worlds,714
36,"at its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small",The War of the Worlds,715
36,"vertical black shapes upon the black ground.  As the green smoke arose,",The War of the Worlds,716
36,"their faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished.",The War of the Worlds,717
36,"Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud,",The War of the Worlds,718
36,"droning noise.  Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the",The War of the Worlds,719
36,ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.,The War of the Worlds,720
36,"",The War of the Worlds,721
36,"Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one",The War of the Worlds,722
36,"to another, sprang from the scattered group of men.  It was as if some",The War of the Worlds,723
36,invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame.  It was,The War of the Worlds,724
36,as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.,The War of the Worlds,725
36,"",The War of the Worlds,726
36,"Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering",The War of the Worlds,727
36,"and falling, and their supporters turning to run.",The War of the Worlds,728
36,"",The War of the Worlds,729
36,"I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping",The War of the Worlds,730
36,from man to man in that little distant crowd.  All I felt was that it,The War of the Worlds,731
36,was something very strange.  An almost noiseless and blinding flash of,The War of the Worlds,732
36,"light, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft",The War of the Worlds,733
36,"of heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry",The War of the Worlds,734
36,furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames.  And far away,The War of the Worlds,735
36,towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden,The War of the Worlds,736
36,buildings suddenly set alight.,The War of the Worlds,737
36,"",The War of the Worlds,738
36,"It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death,",The War of the Worlds,739
36,"this invisible, inevitable sword of heat.  I perceived it coming",The War of the Worlds,740
36,"towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded",The War of the Worlds,741
36,and stupefied to stir.  I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits,The War of the Worlds,742
36,and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled.  Then,The War of the Worlds,743
36,it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn,The War of the Worlds,744
36,"through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along a",The War of the Worlds,745
36,curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled.,The War of the Worlds,746
36,Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from,The War of the Worlds,747
36,Woking station opens out on the common.  Forth-with the hissing and,The War of the Worlds,748
36,"humming ceased, and the black, dome-like object sank slowly out of",The War of the Worlds,749
36,sight into the pit.,The War of the Worlds,750
36,"",The War of the Worlds,751
36,All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood,The War of the Worlds,752
36,"motionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light.  Had that",The War of the Worlds,753
36,"death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in",The War of the Worlds,754
36,"my surprise.  But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me",The War of the Worlds,755
36,suddenly dark and unfamiliar.,The War of the Worlds,756
36,"",The War of the Worlds,757
36,"The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except",The War of the Worlds,758
36,where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the,The War of the Worlds,759
36,"early night.  It was dark, and suddenly void of men.  Overhead the",The War of the Worlds,760
36,"stars were mustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale,",The War of the Worlds,761
36,"bright, almost greenish blue.  The tops of the pine trees and the",The War of the Worlds,762
36,roofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the western,The War of the Worlds,763
36,afterglow.  The Martians and their appliances were altogether,The War of the Worlds,764
36,"invisible, save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror",The War of the Worlds,765
36,wobbled.  Patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and,The War of the Worlds,766
36,"glowed still, and the houses towards Woking station were sending up",The War of the Worlds,767
36,spires of flame into the stillness of the evening air.,The War of the Worlds,768
36,"",The War of the Worlds,769
36,Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment.  The,The War of the Worlds,770
36,little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out,The War of the Worlds,771
36,"of existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me,",The War of the Worlds,772
36,had scarcely been broken.,The War of the Worlds,773
36,"",The War of the Worlds,774
36,"It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless,",The War of the Worlds,775

36,"without, came--fear.",The War of the Worlds,777
36,"",The War of the Worlds,778

36,"The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only",The War of the Worlds,782

36,extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping,The War of the Worlds,784
36,"silently as a child might do.  Once I had turned, I did not dare to",The War of the Worlds,785
36,look back.,The War of the Worlds,786

36,"",The War of the Worlds,799
36,It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay,The War of the Worlds,800
36,men so swiftly and so silently.  Many think that in some way they are,The War of the Worlds,801
36,able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute,The War of the Worlds,802
36,non-conductivity.  This intense heat they project in a parallel beam,The War of the Worlds,803
36,"against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic",The War of the Worlds,804
36,"mirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a",The War of the Worlds,805
36,lighthouse projects a beam of light.  But no one has absolutely proved,The War of the Worlds,806
36,"these details.  However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat",The War of the Worlds,807
36,"is the essence of the matter.  Heat, and invisible, instead of",The War of the Worlds,808
36,"visible, light.  Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its",The War of the Worlds,809

36,common from Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze.,The War of the Worlds,815
36,"",The War of the Worlds,816
36,"The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and",The War of the Worlds,817

36,"forth, attracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the",The War of the Worlds,820
36,Horsell Bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at,The War of the Worlds,821
36,last upon the common.  You may imagine the young people brushed up,The War of the Worlds,822
36,"after the labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would",The War of the Worlds,823
36,"make any novelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a",The War of the Worlds,824
36,trivial flirtation.  You may figure to yourself the hum of voices,The War of the Worlds,825
36,along the road in the gloaming. . . .,The War of the Worlds,826
36,"",The War of the Worlds,827
36,"As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder",The War of the Worlds,828

36,the post office with a special wire to an evening paper.,The War of the Worlds,830
36,"",The War of the Worlds,831
36,"As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they",The War of the Worlds,832
36,found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the,The War of the Worlds,833
36,"spinning mirror over the sand pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt,",The War of the Worlds,834
36,soon infected by the excitement of the occasion.,The War of the Worlds,835
36,"",The War of the Worlds,836
36,"By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may",The War of the Worlds,837
36,"have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place,",The War of the Worlds,838
36,besides those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer.,The War of the Worlds,839
36,"There were three policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their",The War of the Worlds,840
36,"best, under instructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter",The War of the Worlds,841
36,them from approaching the cylinder.  There was some booing from those,The War of the Worlds,842
36,more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an,The War of the Worlds,843
36,occasion for noise and horse-play.,The War of the Worlds,844
36,"",The War of the Worlds,845
36,"Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision,",The War of the Worlds,846

36,"emerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these",The War of the Worlds,848
36,strange creatures from violence.  After that they returned to lead that,The War of the Worlds,849
36,"ill-fated advance.  The description of their death, as it was seen by",The War of the Worlds,850
36,"the crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three",The War of the Worlds,851
36,"puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame.",The War of the Worlds,852
36,"",The War of the Worlds,853
36,But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine.  Only,The War of the Worlds,854
36,the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of,The War of the Worlds,855
36,the Heat-Ray saved them.  Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror,The War of the Worlds,856
36,"been a few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale.  They",The War of the Worlds,857
36,"saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were,",The War of the Worlds,858
36,"lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight.  Then,",The War of the Worlds,859
36,"with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam",The War of the Worlds,860
36,"swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees",The War of the Worlds,861

36,"firing the window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a",The War of the Worlds,863

36,"",The War of the Worlds,865
36,"In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the",The War of the Worlds,866
36,panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some,The War of the Worlds,867
36,"moments.  Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and",The War of the Worlds,868
36,single leaves like puffs of flame.  Hats and dresses caught fire.  Then,The War of the Worlds,869
36,"came a crying from the common.  There were shrieks and shouts, and",The War of the Worlds,870
36,suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with,The War of the Worlds,871
36,"his hands clasped over his head, screaming.",The War of the Worlds,872
36,"",The War of the Worlds,873
36,"""They're coming!"" a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was",The War of the Worlds,874
36,"turning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to",The War of the Worlds,875
36,Woking again.  They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep.,The War of the Worlds,876
36,Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd,The War of the Worlds,877
36,"jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred.  All that crowd did not",The War of the Worlds,878
36,"escape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, were",The War of the Worlds,879
36,"crushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror and the",The War of the Worlds,880

36,HOW I REACHED HOME,The War of the Worlds,887
36,"",The War of the Worlds,888
36,"",The War of the Worlds,889
36,"For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress",The War of the Worlds,890
36,of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather.  All,The War of the Worlds,891
36,about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless,The War of the Worlds,892
36,"sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before",The War of the Worlds,893
36,it descended and smote me out of life.  I came into the road between,The War of the Worlds,894
36,"the crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.",The War of the Worlds,895
36,"",The War of the Worlds,896
36,At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of,The War of the Worlds,897
36,"my emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside.",The War of the Worlds,898
36,That was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks.  I,The War of the Worlds,899
36,fell and lay still.,The War of the Worlds,900
36,"",The War of the Worlds,901
36,I must have remained there some time.,The War of the Worlds,902
36,"",The War of the Worlds,903
36,"I sat up, strangely perplexed.  For a moment, perhaps, I could not",The War of the Worlds,904
36,clearly understand how I came there.  My terror had fallen from me,The War of the Worlds,905
36,"like a garment.  My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away from",The War of the Worlds,906
36,"its fastener.  A few minutes before, there had only been three real",The War of the Worlds,907
36,"things before me--the immensity of the night and space and nature, my",The War of the Worlds,908
36,"own feebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death.  Now it",The War of the Worlds,909
36,"was as if something turned over, and the point of view altered",The War of the Worlds,910
36,abruptly.  There was no sensible transition from one state of mind to,The War of the Worlds,911
36,"the other.  I was immediately the self of every day again--a decent,",The War of the Worlds,912
36,"ordinary citizen.  The silent common, the impulse of my flight, the",The War of the Worlds,913
36,"starting flames, were as if they had been in a dream.  I asked myself",The War of the Worlds,914
36,had these latter things indeed happened?  I could not credit it.,The War of the Worlds,915
36,"",The War of the Worlds,916
36,I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge.  My,The War of the Worlds,917
36,mind was blank wonder.  My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their,The War of the Worlds,918
36,strength.  I dare say I staggered drunkenly.  A head rose over the,The War of the Worlds,919
36,"arch, and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared.  Beside",The War of the Worlds,920
36,"him ran a little boy.  He passed me, wishing me good night.  I was",The War of the Worlds,921
36,"minded to speak to him, but did not.  I answered his greeting with a",The War of the Worlds,922
36,meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge.,The War of the Worlds,923
36,"",The War of the Worlds,924
36,"Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit",The War of the Worlds,925
36,"smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying",The War of the Worlds,926
36,"south--clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone.  A dim group of",The War of the Worlds,927
36,people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little,The War of the Worlds,928
36,row of gables that was called Oriental Terrace.  It was all so real,The War of the Worlds,929
36,"and so familiar.  And that behind me!  It was frantic, fantastic!",The War of the Worlds,930
36,"Such things, I told myself, could not be.",The War of the Worlds,931
36,"",The War of the Worlds,932
36,Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods.  I do not know how far my,The War of the Worlds,933
36,experience is common.  At times I suffer from the strangest sense of,The War of the Worlds,934
36,detachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all,The War of the Worlds,935
36,"from the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time,",The War of the Worlds,936
36,"out of space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all.  This feeling",The War of the Worlds,937
36,was very strong upon me that night.  Here was another side to my,The War of the Worlds,938
36,dream.,The War of the Worlds,939
36,"",The War of the Worlds,940
36,But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the,The War of the Worlds,941
36,"swift death flying yonder, not two miles away.  There was a noise of",The War of the Worlds,942
36,"business from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight.  I",The War of the Worlds,943
36,stopped at the group of people.,The War of the Worlds,944
36,"",The War of the Worlds,945
36,"""What news from the common?"" said I.",The War of the Worlds,946
36,"",The War of the Worlds,947
36,There were two men and a woman at the gate.,The War of the Worlds,948
36,"",The War of the Worlds,949
36,"""Eh?"" said one of the men, turning.",The War of the Worlds,950
36,"",The War of the Worlds,951
36,"""What news from the common?"" I said.",The War of the Worlds,952
36,"",The War of the Worlds,953
36,"""'Ain't yer just _been_ there?"" asked the men.",The War of the Worlds,954
36,"",The War of the Worlds,955
36,"""People seem fair silly about the common,"" said the woman over the",The War of the Worlds,956
36,"gate.  ""What's it all abart?""",The War of the Worlds,957
36,"",The War of the Worlds,958
36,"""Haven't you heard of the men from Mars?"" said I; ""the creatures",The War of the Worlds,959
36,"from Mars?""",The War of the Worlds,960
36,"",The War of the Worlds,961
36,"""Quite enough,"" said the woman over the gate.  ""Thenks""; and all",The War of the Worlds,962
36,three of them laughed.,The War of the Worlds,963
36,"",The War of the Worlds,964
36,I felt foolish and angry.  I tried and found I could not tell them,The War of the Worlds,965
36,what I had seen.  They laughed again at my broken sentences.,The War of the Worlds,966
36,"",The War of the Worlds,967
36,"""You'll hear more yet,"" I said, and went on to my home.",The War of the Worlds,968
36,"",The War of the Worlds,969
36,"I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I.  I went into",The War of the Worlds,970
36,"the dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could",The War of the Worlds,971
36,collect myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen.  The,The War of the Worlds,972
36,"dinner, which was a cold one, had already been served, and remained",The War of the Worlds,973
36,neglected on the table while I told my story.,The War of the Worlds,974
36,"",The War of the Worlds,975
36,"""There is one thing,"" I said, to allay the fears I had aroused;",The War of the Worlds,976
36,"""they are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl.  They may keep",The War of the Worlds,977
36,"the pit and kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out",The War of the Worlds,978
36,"of it. . . .  But the horror of them!""",The War of the Worlds,979
36,"",The War of the Worlds,980
36,"""Don't, dear!"" said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her",The War of the Worlds,981
36,hand on mine.,The War of the Worlds,982
36,"",The War of the Worlds,983
36,"""Poor Ogilvy!"" I said.  ""To think he may be lying dead there!""",The War of the Worlds,984
36,"",The War of the Worlds,985
36,My wife at least did not find my experience incredible.  When I saw,The War of the Worlds,986
36,"how deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.",The War of the Worlds,987
36,"",The War of the Worlds,988
36,"""They may come here,"" she said again and again.",The War of the Worlds,989
36,"",The War of the Worlds,990
36,"I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.",The War of the Worlds,991
36,"",The War of the Worlds,992
36,"""They can scarcely move,"" I said.",The War of the Worlds,993
36,"",The War of the Worlds,994
36,I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had,The War of the Worlds,995
36,told me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves,The War of the Worlds,996
36,on the earth.  In particular I laid stress on the gravitational,The War of the Worlds,997
36,difficulty.  On the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three,The War of the Worlds,998
36,"times what it is on the surface of Mars.  A Martian, therefore, would",The War of the Worlds,999
36,"weigh three times more than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength",The War of the Worlds,1000
36,"would be the same.  His own body would be a cope of lead to him.  That,",The War of the Worlds,1001
36,"indeed, was the general opinion.  Both _The Times_ and the _Daily",The War of the Worlds,1002
36,"Telegraph_, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, and both",The War of the Worlds,1003
36,"overlooked, just as I did, two obvious modifying influences.",The War of the Worlds,1004
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1005
36,"The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen",The War of the Worlds,1006
36,or far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars.,The War of the Worlds,1007
36,The invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians,The War of the Worlds,1008
36,indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their,The War of the Worlds,1009
36,"bodies.  And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that",The War of the Worlds,1010
36,such mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able,The War of the Worlds,1011
36,to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.,The War of the Worlds,1012
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1013
36,"But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my",The War of the Worlds,1014
36,reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders.  With wine and,The War of the Worlds,1015
36,"food, the confidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring",The War of the Worlds,1016
36,"my wife, I grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure.",The War of the Worlds,1017
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1018
36,"""They have done a foolish thing,"" said I, fingering my wineglass.",The War of the Worlds,1019
36,"""They are dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror.",The War of the Worlds,1020
36,Perhaps they expected to find no living things--certainly no,The War of the Worlds,1021
36,"intelligent living things.""",The War of the Worlds,1022
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1023
36,"""A shell in the pit"" said I, ""if the worst comes to the worst will",The War of the Worlds,1024
36,"kill them all.""",The War of the Worlds,1025
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1026
36,The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my,The War of the Worlds,1027
36,perceptive powers in a state of erethism.  I remember that dinner,The War of the Worlds,1028
36,table with extraordinary vividness even now.  My dear wife's sweet,The War of the Worlds,1029
36,"anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white",The War of the Worlds,1030
36,cloth with its silver and glass table furniture--for in those days,The War of the Worlds,1031
36,even philosophical writers had many little luxuries--the crimson-purple,The War of the Worlds,1032
36,"wine in my glass, are photographically distinct.  At the end of",The War of the Worlds,1033
36,"it I sat, tempering nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy's",The War of the Worlds,1034
36,"rashness, and denouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians.",The War of the Worlds,1035
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1036
36,So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in,The War of the Worlds,1037

36,"",The War of the Worlds,1050
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1051
36,"The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and",The War of the Worlds,1052
36,"wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing",The War of the Worlds,1053
36,of the commonplace habits of our social order with the first,The War of the Worlds,1054
36,beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social,The War of the Worlds,1055
36,order headlong.  If on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses,The War of the Worlds,1056
36,and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand,The War of the Worlds,1057
36,"pits, I doubt if you would have had one human being outside it, unless",The War of the Worlds,1058
36,it were some relation of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or,The War of the Worlds,1059
36,"London people lying dead on the common, whose emotions or habits were",The War of the Worlds,1060
36,at all affected by the new-comers.  Many people had heard of the,The War of the Worlds,1061
36,"cylinder, of course, and talked about it in their leisure, but it",The War of the Worlds,1062
36,certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to Germany,The War of the Worlds,1063
36,would have done.,The War of the Worlds,1064
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1065
36,In London that night poor Henderson's telegram describing the,The War of the Worlds,1066
36,"gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his",The War of the Worlds,1067
36,"evening paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving",The War of the Worlds,1068
36,no reply--the man was killed--decided not to print a special edition.,The War of the Worlds,1069
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1070
36,Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were,The War of the Worlds,1071
36,inert.  I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to,The War of the Worlds,1072
36,whom I spoke.  All over the district people were dining and supping;,The War of the Worlds,1073
36,"working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children",The War of the Worlds,1074
36,"were being put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes",The War of the Worlds,1075
36,"love-making, students sat over their books.",The War of the Worlds,1076
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1077
36,"Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and",The War of the Worlds,1078
36,"dominant topic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger,",The War of the Worlds,1079
36,"or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of",The War of the Worlds,1080
36,"excitement, a shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most",The War of the Worlds,1081
36,"part the daily routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on",The War of the Worlds,1082
36,as it had done for countless years--as though no planet Mars existed,The War of the Worlds,1083
36,in the sky.  Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was,The War of the Worlds,1084
36,the case.,The War of the Worlds,1085
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1086
36,"In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and",The War of the Worlds,1087
36,"going on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were",The War of the Worlds,1088
36,"alighting and waiting, and everything was proceeding in the most",The War of the Worlds,1089
36,"ordinary way.  A boy from the town, trenching on Smith's monopoly, was",The War of the Worlds,1090
36,selling papers with the afternoon's news.  The ringing impact of,The War of the Worlds,1091
36,"trucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction, mingled",The War of the Worlds,1092
36,"with their shouts of ""Men from Mars!""  Excited men came into the",The War of the Worlds,1093
36,"station about nine o'clock with incredible tidings, and caused no more",The War of the Worlds,1094
36,disturbance than drunkards might have done.  People rattling,The War of the Worlds,1095
36,"Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows, and",The War of the Worlds,1096
36,"saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark dance up from the",The War of the Worlds,1097
36,"direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving",The War of the Worlds,1098
36,"across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious than a heath",The War of the Worlds,1099
36,fire was happening.  It was only round the edge of the common that any,The War of the Worlds,1100
36,disturbance was perceptible.  There were half a dozen villas burning,The War of the Worlds,1101
36,on the Woking border.  There were lights in all the houses on the,The War of the Worlds,1102
36,"common side of the three villages, and the people there kept awake",The War of the Worlds,1103
36,till dawn.,The War of the Worlds,1104
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1105
36,"A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but",The War of the Worlds,1106
36,"the crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges.  One or",The War of the Worlds,1107
36,"two adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness",The War of the Worlds,1108
36,"and crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now",The War of the Worlds,1109
36,"and again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship's searchlight swept",The War of the Worlds,1110
36,"the common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow.  Save for such, that",The War of the Worlds,1111
36,"big area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay",The War of the Worlds,1112
36,"about on it all night under the stars, and all the next day.  A noise",The War of the Worlds,1113
36,of hammering from the pit was heard by many people.,The War of the Worlds,1114
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1115
36,"So you have the state of things on Friday night.  In the centre,",The War of the Worlds,1116
36,"sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,",The War of the Worlds,1117
36,was this cylinder.  But the poison was scarcely working yet.  Around,The War of the Worlds,1118
36,"it was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few",The War of the Worlds,1119
36,"dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there.",The War of the Worlds,1120
36,Here and there was a burning bush or tree.  Beyond was a fringe of,The War of the Worlds,1121
36,"excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not",The War of the Worlds,1122
36,crept as yet.  In the rest of the world the stream of life still,The War of the Worlds,1123
36,flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years.  The fever of war that,The War of the Worlds,1124
36,"would presently clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain,",The War of the Worlds,1125
36,had still to develop.,The War of the Worlds,1126
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1127
36,"All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,",The War of the Worlds,1128
36,"indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and",The War of the Worlds,1129
36,ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the,The War of the Worlds,1130
36,starlit sky.,The War of the Worlds,1131
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1132
36,"About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and",The War of the Worlds,1133
36,deployed along the edge of the common to form a cordon.  Later a,The War of the Worlds,1134
36,second company marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of,The War of the Worlds,1135
36,the common.  Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on,The War of the Worlds,1136
36,"the common earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be",The War of the Worlds,1137
36,missing.  The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and,The War of the Worlds,1138
36,was busy questioning the crowd at midnight.  The military authorities,The War of the Worlds,1139
36,were certainly alive to the seriousness of the business.  About,The War of the Worlds,1140
36,"eleven, the next morning's papers were able to say, a squadron of",The War of the Worlds,1141
36,"hussars, two Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan",The War of the Worlds,1142
36,regiment started from Aldershot.,The War of the Worlds,1143
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1144
36,"A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road,",The War of the Worlds,1145
36,"Woking, saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the",The War of the Worlds,1146
36,"northwest.  It had a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness",The War of the Worlds,1147

36,"barometer.  I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in",The War of the Worlds,1159
36,"sleeping, and I rose early.  I went into my garden before breakfast",The War of the Worlds,1160
36,"and stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring",The War of the Worlds,1161
36,but a lark.,The War of the Worlds,1162
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1163
36,The milkman came as usual.  I heard the rattle of his chariot and I,The War of the Worlds,1164
36,went round to the side gate to ask the latest news.  He told me that,The War of the Worlds,1165
36,"during the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that",The War of the Worlds,1166
36,"guns were expected.  Then--a familiar, reassuring note--I heard a train",The War of the Worlds,1167
36,running towards Woking.,The War of the Worlds,1168
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1169
36,"""They aren't to be killed,"" said the milkman, ""if that can possibly",The War of the Worlds,1170
36,"be avoided.""",The War of the Worlds,1171
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1172
36,"I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then",The War of the Worlds,1173
36,strolled in to breakfast.  It was a most unexceptional morning.  My,The War of the Worlds,1174
36,neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or,The War of the Worlds,1175
36,to destroy the Martians during the day.,The War of the Worlds,1176
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1177
36,"""It's a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,"" he said.  ""It",The War of the Worlds,1178
36,would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might,The War of the Worlds,1179
36,"learn a thing or two.""",The War of the Worlds,1180
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1181
36,"He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for",The War of the Worlds,1182
36,his gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic.  At the same,The War of the Worlds,1183
36,time he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet,The War of the Worlds,1184
36,Golf Links.,The War of the Worlds,1185
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1186
36,"""They say,"" said he, ""that there's another of those blessed things",The War of the Worlds,1187
36,"fallen there--number two.  But one's enough, surely.  This lot'll cost",The War of the Worlds,1188
36,"the insurance people a pretty penny before everything's settled.""  He",The War of the Worlds,1189
36,laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this.  The,The War of the Worlds,1190
36,"woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to",The War of the Worlds,1191
36,"me.  ""They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick",The War of the Worlds,1192
36,"soil of pine needles and turf,"" he said, and then grew serious over",The War of the Worlds,1193
36,"""poor Ogilvy.""",The War of the Worlds,1194
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1195
36,"After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down",The War of the Worlds,1196
36,towards the common.  Under the railway bridge I found a group of,The War of the Worlds,1197
36,"soldiers--sappers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets",The War of the Worlds,1198
36,"unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots",The War of the Worlds,1199
36,"coming to the calf.  They told me no one was allowed over the canal,",The War of the Worlds,1200
36,"and, looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw one of the",The War of the Worlds,1201
36,Cardigan men standing sentinel there.  I talked with these soldiers,The War of the Worlds,1202
36,for a time; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous,The War of the Worlds,1203
36,"evening.  None of them had seen the Martians, and they had but the",The War of the Worlds,1204
36,"vaguest ideas of them, so that they plied me with questions.  They",The War of the Worlds,1205
36,said that they did not know who had authorised the movements of the,The War of the Worlds,1206
36,troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen at the Horse Guards.,The War of the Worlds,1207
36,The ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than the common,The War of the Worlds,1208
36,"soldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possible",The War of the Worlds,1209
36,"fight with some acuteness.  I described the Heat-Ray to them, and they",The War of the Worlds,1210
36,began to argue among themselves.,The War of the Worlds,1211
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1212
36,"""Crawl up under cover and rush 'em, say I,"" said one.",The War of the Worlds,1213
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1214
36,"""Get aht!"" said another.  ""What's cover against this 'ere 'eat?",The War of the Worlds,1215
36,Sticks to cook yer!  What we got to do is to go as near as the,The War of the Worlds,1216
36,"ground'll let us, and then drive a trench.""",The War of the Worlds,1217

36,"been born a rabbit Snippy.""",The War of the Worlds,1220
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1221
36,"""Ain't they got any necks, then?"" said a third, abruptly--a little,",The War of the Worlds,1222
36,"contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.",The War of the Worlds,1223
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1224
36,I repeated my description.,The War of the Worlds,1225
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1226
36,"""Octopuses,"" said he, ""that's what I calls 'em.  Talk about fishers",The War of the Worlds,1227
36,"of men--fighters of fish it is this time!""",The War of the Worlds,1228
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1229
36,"""It ain't no murder killing beasts like that,"" said the first",The War of the Worlds,1230
36,speaker.,The War of the Worlds,1231
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1232
36,"""Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish 'em?"" said",The War of the Worlds,1233
36,"the little dark man.  ""You carn tell what they might do.""",The War of the Worlds,1234
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1235

36,"time.  Do it in a rush, that's my tip, and do it at once.""",The War of the Worlds,1237
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1238
36,"So they discussed it.  After a while I left them, and went on to",The War of the Worlds,1239
36,the railway station to get as many morning papers as I could.,The War of the Worlds,1240
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1241
36,But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long,The War of the Worlds,1242
36,morning and of the longer afternoon.  I did not succeed in getting a,The War of the Worlds,1243
36,"glimpse of the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were",The War of the Worlds,1244
36,in the hands of the military authorities.  The soldiers I addressed,The War of the Worlds,1245
36,didn't know anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy.  I,The War of the Worlds,1246
36,found people in the town quite secure again in the presence of the,The War of the Worlds,1247
36,"military, and I heard for the first time from Marshall, the",The War of the Worlds,1248
36,"tobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the common.  The",The War of the Worlds,1249
36,soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and,The War of the Worlds,1250
36,leave their houses.,The War of the Worlds,1251
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1252
36,"I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the",The War of the Worlds,1253
36,day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took,The War of the Worlds,1254
36,a cold bath in the afternoon.  About half past four I went up to the,The War of the Worlds,1255
36,"railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had",The War of the Worlds,1256
36,"contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,",The War of the Worlds,1257
36,"Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others.  But there was little I didn't",The War of the Worlds,1258
36,know.  The Martians did not show an inch of themselves.  They seemed,The War of the Worlds,1259
36,"busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost",The War of the Worlds,1260
36,continuous streamer of smoke.  Apparently they were busy getting ready,The War of the Worlds,1261
36,"for a struggle.  ""Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without",The War of the Worlds,1262
36,"success,"" was the stereotyped formula of the papers.  A sapper told me",The War of the Worlds,1263
36,it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole.  The,The War of the Worlds,1264
36,Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the,The War of the Worlds,1265
36,lowing of a cow.,The War of the Worlds,1266
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1267
36,"I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this",The War of the Worlds,1268
36,"preparation, greatly excited me.  My imagination became belligerent,",The War of the Worlds,1269
36,and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my,The War of the Worlds,1270
36,schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back.  It hardly seemed a,The War of the Worlds,1271
36,fair fight to me at that time.  They seemed very helpless in that pit,The War of the Worlds,1272
36,of theirs.,The War of the Worlds,1273
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1274
36,About three o'clock there began the thud of a gun at measured,The War of the Worlds,1275
36,intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone.  I learned that the smouldering,The War of the Worlds,1276
36,"pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled,",The War of the Worlds,1277
36,in the hope of destroying that object before it opened.  It was only,The War of the Worlds,1278
36,"about five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against",The War of the Worlds,1279
36,the first body of Martians.,The War of the Worlds,1280
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1281
36,"About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the",The War of the Worlds,1282
36,summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon,The War of the Worlds,1283
36,"us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately",The War of the Worlds,1284
36,after a gust of firing.  Close on the heels of that came a violent,The War of the Worlds,1285
36,"rattling crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and,",The War of the Worlds,1286
36,"starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the",The War of the Worlds,1287
36,"Oriental College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of the",The War of the Worlds,1288
36,little church beside it slide down into ruin.  The pinnacle of the,The War of the Worlds,1289
36,"mosque had vanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked as",The War of the Worlds,1290
36,if a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it.  One of our chimneys,The War of the Worlds,1291
36,"cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece of it came",The War of the Worlds,1292
36,clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon,The War of the Worlds,1293
36,the flower bed by my study window.,The War of the Worlds,1294
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1295
36,I and my wife stood amazed.  Then I realised that the crest of,The War of the Worlds,1296
36,Maybury Hill must be within range of the Martians' Heat-Ray now that,The War of the Worlds,1297
36,the college was cleared out of the way.,The War of the Worlds,1298
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1299
36,"At that I gripped my wife's arm, and without ceremony ran her out",The War of the Worlds,1300
36,"into the road.  Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go",The War of the Worlds,1301
36,upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for.,The War of the Worlds,1302
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1303
36,"""We can't possibly stay here,"" I said; and as I spoke the firing",The War of the Worlds,1304
36,reopened for a moment upon the common.,The War of the Worlds,1305
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1306
36,"""But where are we to go?"" said my wife in terror.",The War of the Worlds,1307
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1308
36,I thought perplexed.  Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead.,The War of the Worlds,1309
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1310
36,"""Leatherhead!"" I shouted above the sudden noise.",The War of the Worlds,1311
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1312
36,She looked away from me downhill.  The people were coming out of,The War of the Worlds,1313
36,"their houses, astonished.",The War of the Worlds,1314
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1315
36,"""How are we to get to Leatherhead?"" she said.",The War of the Worlds,1316
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1317
36,Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway,The War of the Worlds,1318
36,bridge; three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College;,The War of the Worlds,1319
36,"two others dismounted, and began running from house to house.  The",The War of the Worlds,1320
36,"sun, shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the",The War of the Worlds,1321
36,"trees, seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon",The War of the Worlds,1322
36,everything.,The War of the Worlds,1323
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1324
36,"""Stop here,"" said I; ""you are safe here""; and I started off at once",The War of the Worlds,1325
36,"for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart.",The War of the Worlds,1326
36,"I ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the",The War of the Worlds,1327
36,"hill would be moving.  I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what",The War of the Worlds,1328
36,"was going on behind his house.  A man stood with his back to me,",The War of the Worlds,1329
36,talking to him.,The War of the Worlds,1330
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1331
36,"""I must have a pound,"" said the landlord, ""and I've no one to drive",The War of the Worlds,1332

36,"""What for?""",The War of the Worlds,1337
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1338
36,"""And I'll bring it back by midnight,"" I said.",The War of the Worlds,1339
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1340
36,"""Lord!"" said the landlord; ""what's the hurry?  I'm selling my bit",The War of the Worlds,1341
36,"of a pig.  Two pounds, and you bring it back?  What's going on now?""",The War of the Worlds,1342
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1343
36,"I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the",The War of the Worlds,1344
36,dog cart.  At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the,The War of the Worlds,1345
36,landlord should leave his.  I took care to have the cart there and,The War of the Worlds,1346
36,"then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife",The War of the Worlds,1347
36,"and servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such",The War of the Worlds,1348
36,"plate as we had, and so forth.  The beech trees below the house were",The War of the Worlds,1349
36,"burning while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red.",The War of the Worlds,1350
36,"While I was occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came",The War of the Worlds,1351
36,"running up.  He was going from house to house, warning people to",The War of the Worlds,1352
36,"leave.  He was going on as I came out of my front door, lugging my",The War of the Worlds,1353
36,"treasures, done up in a tablecloth.  I shouted after him:",The War of the Worlds,1354
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1355
36,"""What news?""",The War of the Worlds,1356
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1357
36,"He turned, stared, bawled something about ""crawling out in a thing",The War of the Worlds,1358
36,"like a dish cover,"" and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest.",The War of the Worlds,1359
36,A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a,The War of the Worlds,1360
36,moment.  I ran to my neighbour's door and rapped to satisfy myself of,The War of the Worlds,1361
36,"what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had",The War of the Worlds,1362
36,"locked up their house.  I went in again, according to my promise, to",The War of the Worlds,1363
36,"get my servant's box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail",The War of the Worlds,1364
36,"of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the",The War of the Worlds,1365
36,driver's seat beside my wife.  In another moment we were clear of the,The War of the Worlds,1366
36,"smoke and noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill",The War of the Worlds,1367
36,towards Old Woking.,The War of the Worlds,1368
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1369
36,"In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either",The War of the Worlds,1370
36,"side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign.  I saw",The War of the Worlds,1371
36,the doctor's cart ahead of me.  At the bottom of the hill I turned my,The War of the Worlds,1372
36,head to look at the hillside I was leaving.  Thick streamers of black,The War of the Worlds,1373
36,smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still,The War of the Worlds,1374
36,"air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward.  The",The War of the Worlds,1375
36,smoke already extended far away to the east and west--to the Byfleet,The War of the Worlds,1376
36,"pine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west.  The road was dotted",The War of the Worlds,1377
36,"with people running towards us.  And very faint now, but very distinct",The War of the Worlds,1378
36,"through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that",The War of the Worlds,1379
36,"was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles.",The War of the Worlds,1380

36,attention to the horse.  When I looked back again the second hill had,The War of the Worlds,1385
36,"hidden the black smoke.  I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave",The War of the Worlds,1386
36,him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that,The War of the Worlds,1387

36,Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill.  The scent of,The War of the Worlds,1398

36,hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses.,The War of the Worlds,1400
36,The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down,The War of the Worlds,1401
36,"Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very",The War of the Worlds,1402
36,peaceful and still.  We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about,The War of the Worlds,1403
36,"nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper",The War of the Worlds,1404
36,with my cousins and commended my wife to their care.,The War of the Worlds,1405
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1406
36,"My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed",The War of the Worlds,1407

36,pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer,The War of the Worlds,1409
36,"heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but",The War of the Worlds,1410
36,she answered only in monosyllables.  Had it not been for my promise to,The War of the Worlds,1411
36,"the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in",The War of the Worlds,1412
36,"Leatherhead that night.  Would that I had!  Her face, I remember, was",The War of the Worlds,1413
36,very white as we parted.,The War of the Worlds,1414

36,very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised,The War of the Worlds,1417
36,"community had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very",The War of the Worlds,1418
36,sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night.  I was even afraid,The War of the Worlds,1419
36,that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of,The War of the Worlds,1420
36,our invaders from Mars.  I can best express my state of mind by saying,The War of the Worlds,1421
36,that I wanted to be in at the death.,The War of the Worlds,1422
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1423
36,It was nearly eleven when I started to return.  The night was,The War of the Worlds,1424

36,I knew the road intimately.  My wife stood in the light of the,The War of the Worlds,1429

36,"fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians.  At that",The War of the Worlds,1435
36,time I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening's,The War of the Worlds,1436
36,fighting.  I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated,The War of the Worlds,1437
36,the conflict.  As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I,The War of the Worlds,1438
36,"returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western",The War of the Worlds,1439
36,"horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the",The War of the Worlds,1440
36,sky.  The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there,The War of the Worlds,1441
36,with masses of black and red smoke.,The War of the Worlds,1442
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1443
36,"Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so",The War of the Worlds,1444
36,the village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an,The War of the Worlds,1445
36,"accident at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people",The War of the Worlds,1446
36,stood with their backs to me.  They said nothing to me as I passed.  I,The War of the Worlds,1447
36,"do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill,",The War of the Worlds,1448
36,nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping,The War of the Worlds,1449
36,"securely, or deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the",The War of the Worlds,1450
36,terror of the night.,The War of the Worlds,1451
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1452
36,From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the,The War of the Worlds,1453
36,"Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me.  As I ascended the little",The War of the Worlds,1454
36,"hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the",The War of the Worlds,1455
36,trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that,The War of the Worlds,1456
36,was upon me.  Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church,The War of the Worlds,1457
36,"behind me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its",The War of the Worlds,1458
36,tree-tops and roofs black and sharp against the red.,The War of the Worlds,1459
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1460
36,Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and,The War of the Worlds,1461
36,showed the distant woods towards Addlestone.  I felt a tug at the,The War of the Worlds,1462
36,reins.  I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a,The War of the Worlds,1463
36,"thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling",The War of the Worlds,1464
36,into the field to my left.  It was the third falling star!,The War of the Worlds,1465
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1466
36,"Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced",The War of the Worlds,1467
36,"out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst",The War of the Worlds,1468
36,like a rocket overhead.  The horse took the bit between his teeth and,The War of the Worlds,1469
36,bolted.,The War of the Worlds,1470
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1471
36,"A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down",The War of the Worlds,1472
36,"this we clattered.  Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as",The War of the Worlds,1473
36,"rapid a succession of flashes as I have ever seen.  The thunderclaps,",The War of the Worlds,1474
36,treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling,The War of the Worlds,1475
36,"accompaniment, sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric",The War of the Worlds,1476
36,machine than the usual detonating reverberations.  The flickering,The War of the Worlds,1477
36,"light was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my",The War of the Worlds,1478
36,face as I drove down the slope.,The War of the Worlds,1479
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1480
36,"At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then",The War of the Worlds,1481
36,abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving,The War of the Worlds,1482
36,rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill.  At first I took it,The War of the Worlds,1483
36,"for the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another showed it",The War of the Worlds,1484
36,to be in swift rolling movement.  It was an elusive vision--a moment,The War of the Worlds,1485
36,"of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red",The War of the Worlds,1486
36,"masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of",The War of the Worlds,1487
36,"the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp",The War of the Worlds,1488
36,and bright.,The War of the Worlds,1489
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1490
36,"And this Thing I saw!  How can I describe it?  A monstrous tripod,",The War of the Worlds,1491
36,"higher than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and",The War of the Worlds,1492
36,smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering,The War of the Worlds,1493
36,"metal, striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel",The War of the Worlds,1494
36,"dangling from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling",The War of the Worlds,1495
36,"with the riot of the thunder.  A flash, and it came out vividly,",The War of the Worlds,1496
36,"heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear",The War of the Worlds,1497
36,"almost instantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards",The War of the Worlds,1498
36,nearer.  Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently,The War of the Worlds,1499
36,along the ground?  That was the impression those instant flashes gave.,The War of the Worlds,1500
36,But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on,The War of the Worlds,1501
36,a tripod stand.,The War of the Worlds,1502
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1503
36,"Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted,",The War of the Worlds,1504
36,as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were,The War of the Worlds,1505
36,"snapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared,",The War of the Worlds,1506
36,"rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me.  And I was galloping hard",The War of the Worlds,1507
36,to meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went,The War of the Worlds,1508
36,"altogether.  Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse's head",The War of the Worlds,1509
36,hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled,The War of the Worlds,1510
36,"over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung",The War of the Worlds,1511
36,sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water.,The War of the Worlds,1512
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1513
36,"I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in",The War of the Worlds,1514
36,"the water, under a clump of furze.  The horse lay motionless (his neck",The War of the Worlds,1515
36,"was broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black",The War of the Worlds,1516
36,bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still,The War of the Worlds,1517
36,spinning slowly.  In another moment the colossal mechanism went,The War of the Worlds,1518
36,"striding by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.",The War of the Worlds,1519
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1520
36,"Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere",The War of the Worlds,1521
36,"insensate machine driving on its way.  Machine it was, with a ringing",The War of the Worlds,1522
36,"metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which",The War of the Worlds,1523
36,gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange,The War of the Worlds,1524
36,"body.  It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen",The War of the Worlds,1525
36,hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable,The War of the Worlds,1526
36,suggestion of a head looking about.  Behind the main body was a huge,The War of the Worlds,1527
36,"mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs of",The War of the Worlds,1528
36,green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster,The War of the Worlds,1529
36,swept by me.  And in an instant it was gone.,The War of the Worlds,1530
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1531
36,"So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the",The War of the Worlds,1532
36,"lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows.",The War of the Worlds,1533
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1534
36,As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the,The War of the Worlds,1535
36,"thunder--""Aloo!  Aloo!""--and in another minute it was with its",The War of the Worlds,1536
36,"companion, half a mile away, stooping over something in the field.  I",The War of the Worlds,1537
36,have no doubt this Thing in the field was the third of the ten,The War of the Worlds,1538
36,cylinders they had fired at us from Mars.,The War of the Worlds,1539
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1540
36,"For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by",The War of the Worlds,1541
36,"the intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about",The War of the Worlds,1542
36,"in the distance over the hedge tops.  A thin hail was now beginning,",The War of the Worlds,1543
36,and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into,The War of the Worlds,1544
36,"clearness again.  Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the",The War of the Worlds,1545
36,night swallowed them up.,The War of the Worlds,1546
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1547
36,I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below.  It was some,The War of the Worlds,1548
36,time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to,The War of the Worlds,1549
36,"a drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.",The War of the Worlds,1550
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1551
36,"Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter's hut of wood,",The War of the Worlds,1552
36,surrounded by a patch of potato garden.  I struggled to my feet at,The War of the Worlds,1553
36,"last, and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a",The War of the Worlds,1554
36,"run for this.  I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people",The War of the Worlds,1555
36,"hear (if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted,",The War of the Worlds,1556
36,"and, availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way,",The War of the Worlds,1557
36,"succeeded in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into",The War of the Worlds,1558
36,the pine woods towards Maybury.,The War of the Worlds,1559
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1560
36,"Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my",The War of the Worlds,1561
36,own house.  I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath.  It,The War of the Worlds,1562
36,"was very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming",The War of the Worlds,1563
36,"infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in",The War of the Worlds,1564
36,columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage.,The War of the Worlds,1565
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1566
36,If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I,The War of the Worlds,1567
36,should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street,The War of the Worlds,1568
36,"Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead.  But that",The War of the Worlds,1569
36,"night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical",The War of the Worlds,1570
36,"wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin,",The War of the Worlds,1571
36,deafened and blinded by the storm.,The War of the Worlds,1572
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1573
36,"I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as",The War of the Worlds,1574
36,"much motive as I had.  I staggered through the trees, fell into a",The War of the Worlds,1575
36,"ditch and bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out",The War of the Worlds,1576
36,"into the lane that ran down from the College Arms.  I say splashed,",The War of the Worlds,1577
36,for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy,The War of the Worlds,1578
36,torrent.  There in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me,The War of the Worlds,1579
36,reeling back.,The War of the Worlds,1580
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1581
36,"He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I",The War of the Worlds,1582
36,could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him.  So heavy was the,The War of the Worlds,1583
36,stress of the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to,The War of the Worlds,1584
36,win my way up the hill.  I went close up to the fence on the left and,The War of the Worlds,1585
36,worked my way along its palings.,The War of the Worlds,1586
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1587
36,"Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of",The War of the Worlds,1588
36,"lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair",The War of the Worlds,1589
36,"of boots.  Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the",The War of the Worlds,1590
36,flicker of light had passed.  I stood over him waiting for the next,The War of the Worlds,1591
36,"flash.  When it came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not",The War of the Worlds,1592
36,"shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay",The War of the Worlds,1593
36,"crumpled up close to the fence, as though he had been flung violently",The War of the Worlds,1594
36,against it.,The War of the Worlds,1595
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1596
36,Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before,The War of the Worlds,1597
36,"touched a dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his",The War of the Worlds,1598
36,heart.  He was quite dead.  Apparently his neck had been broken.  The,The War of the Worlds,1599
36,"lightning flashed for a third time, and his face leaped upon me.  I",The War of the Worlds,1600
36,"sprang to my feet.  It was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose",The War of the Worlds,1601
36,conveyance I had taken.,The War of the Worlds,1602
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1603
36,I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill.  I made my,The War of the Worlds,1604
36,way by the police station and the College Arms towards my own house.,The War of the Worlds,1605
36,"Nothing was burning on the hillside, though from the common there",The War of the Worlds,1606
36,still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up,The War of the Worlds,1607
36,"against the drenching hail.  So far as I could see by the flashes, the",The War of the Worlds,1608
36,houses about me were mostly uninjured.  By the College Arms a dark,The War of the Worlds,1609
36,heap lay in the road.,The War of the Worlds,1610
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1611
36,Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the,The War of the Worlds,1612
36,"sound of feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them.  I",The War of the Worlds,1613
36,"let myself in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door,",The War of the Worlds,1614
36,"staggered to the foot of the staircase, and sat down.  My imagination",The War of the Worlds,1615
36,"was full of those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body",The War of the Worlds,1616
36,smashed against the fence.,The War of the Worlds,1617
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1618
36,"I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall,",The War of the Worlds,1619
36,shivering violently.,The War of the Worlds,1620

36,AT THE WINDOW,The War of the Worlds,1626
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1627
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1628
36,I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of,The War of the Worlds,1629
36,exhausting themselves.  After a time I discovered that I was cold and,The War of the Worlds,1630
36,"wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet.  I",The War of the Worlds,1631
36,"got up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some",The War of the Worlds,1632
36,"whiskey, and then I was moved to change my clothes.",The War of the Worlds,1633
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1634
36,"After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so",The War of the Worlds,1635
36,I do not know.  The window of my study looks over the trees and the,The War of the Worlds,1636
36,railway towards Horsell Common.  In the hurry of our departure this,The War of the Worlds,1637
36,"window had been left open.  The passage was dark, and, by contrast with",The War of the Worlds,1638
36,"the picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed",The War of the Worlds,1639
36,impenetrably dark.  I stopped short in the doorway.,The War of the Worlds,1640
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1641
36,The thunderstorm had passed.  The towers of the Oriental College,The War of the Worlds,1642
36,"and the pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a",The War of the Worlds,1643
36,"vivid red glare, the common about the sand pits was visible.  Across",The War of the Worlds,1644
36,"the light huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to",The War of the Worlds,1645
36,and fro.,The War of the Worlds,1646
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1647
36,It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on,The War of the Worlds,1648
36,"fire--a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and",The War of the Worlds,1649
36,"writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red",The War of the Worlds,1650
36,reflection upon the cloud-scud above.  Every now and then a haze of,The War of the Worlds,1651
36,smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid,The War of the Worlds,1652
36,"the Martian shapes.  I could not see what they were doing, nor the",The War of the Worlds,1653
36,"clear form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied",The War of the Worlds,1654
36,"upon.  Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of",The War of the Worlds,1655
36,"it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study.  A sharp, resinous",The War of the Worlds,1656
36,tang of burning was in the air.,The War of the Worlds,1657
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1658
36,I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window.  As I,The War of the Worlds,1659
36,"did so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the",The War of the Worlds,1660
36,"houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and",The War of the Worlds,1661
36,blackened pine woods of Byfleet.  There was a light down below the,The War of the Worlds,1662
36,"hill, on the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along",The War of the Worlds,1663
36,the Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins.,The War of the Worlds,1664
36,The light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black,The War of the Worlds,1665
36,"heap and a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow",The War of the Worlds,1666
36,"oblongs.  Then I perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part",The War of the Worlds,1667
36,"smashed and on fire, the hinder carriages still upon the rails.",The War of the Worlds,1668
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1669
36,"Between these three main centres of light--the houses, the train,",The War of the Worlds,1670
36,and the burning county towards Chobham--stretched irregular patches of,The War of the Worlds,1671
36,"dark country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and",The War of the Worlds,1672
36,"smoking ground.  It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set",The War of the Worlds,1673
36,"with fire.  It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries",The War of the Worlds,1674
36,"at night.  At first I could distinguish no people at all, though I",The War of the Worlds,1675
36,peered intently for them.  Later I saw against the light of Woking,The War of the Worlds,1676
36,station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across,The War of the Worlds,1677
36,the line.,The War of the Worlds,1678
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1679
36,And this was the little world in which I had been living securely,The War of the Worlds,1680
36,"for years, this fiery chaos!  What had happened in the last seven",The War of the Worlds,1681
36,"hours I still did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning to",The War of the Worlds,1682
36,"guess, the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish",The War of the Worlds,1683
36,lumps I had seen disgorged from the cylinder.  With a queer feeling of,The War of the Worlds,1684
36,"impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down,",The War of the Worlds,1685
36,"and stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three",The War of the Worlds,1686
36,gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about,The War of the Worlds,1687
36,the sand pits.,The War of the Worlds,1688
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1689
36,They seemed amazingly busy.  I began to ask myself what they could,The War of the Worlds,1690
36,be.  Were they intelligent mechanisms?  Such a thing I felt was,The War of the Worlds,1691
36,"impossible.  Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing,",The War of the Worlds,1692
36,"using, much as a man's brain sits and rules in his body?  I began to",The War of the Worlds,1693
36,"compare the things to human machines, to ask myself for the first time",The War of the Worlds,1694
36,in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an,The War of the Worlds,1695
36,intelligent lower animal.,The War of the Worlds,1696
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1697
36,"The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning",The War of the Worlds,1698
36,"land the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west,",The War of the Worlds,1699
36,when a soldier came into my garden.  I heard a slight scraping at the,The War of the Worlds,1700
36,"fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I",The War of the Worlds,1701
36,"looked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings.  At the",The War of the Worlds,1702
36,"sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of the",The War of the Worlds,1703
36,window eagerly.,The War of the Worlds,1704
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1705
36,"""Hist!"" said I, in a whisper.",The War of the Worlds,1706
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1707
36,He stopped astride of the fence in doubt.  Then he came over and,The War of the Worlds,1708
36,across the lawn to the corner of the house.  He bent down and stepped,The War of the Worlds,1709
36,softly.,The War of the Worlds,1710
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1711
36,"""Who's there?"" he said, also whispering, standing under the window",The War of the Worlds,1712
36,and peering up.,The War of the Worlds,1713
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1714
36,"""Where are you going?"" I asked.",The War of the Worlds,1715
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1716
36,"""God knows.""",The War of the Worlds,1717
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1718
36,"""Are you trying to hide?""",The War of the Worlds,1719
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1720
36,"""That's it.""",The War of the Worlds,1721
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1722
36,"""Come into the house,"" I said.",The War of the Worlds,1723
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1724
36,"I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the",The War of the Worlds,1725
36,"door again.  I could not see his face.  He was hatless, and his coat",The War of the Worlds,1726
36,was unbuttoned.,The War of the Worlds,1727
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1728
36,"""My God!"" he said, as I drew him in.",The War of the Worlds,1729
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1730
36,"""What has happened?"" I asked.",The War of the Worlds,1731
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1732
36,"""What hasn't?""  In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of",The War of the Worlds,1733
36,"despair.  ""They wiped us out--simply wiped us out,"" he repeated again",The War of the Worlds,1734
36,and again.,The War of the Worlds,1735
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1736
36,"He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room.",The War of the Worlds,1737
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1738
36,"""Take some whiskey,"" I said, pouring out a stiff dose.",The War of the Worlds,1739
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1740
36,"He drank it.  Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his",The War of the Worlds,1741
36,"head on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a",The War of the Worlds,1742
36,"perfect passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of",The War of the Worlds,1743
36,"my own recent despair, stood beside him, wondering.",The War of the Worlds,1744
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1745
36,It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my,The War of the Worlds,1746
36,"questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly.  He was a",The War of the Worlds,1747
36,"driver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven.  At",The War of the Worlds,1748
36,"that time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the",The War of the Worlds,1749
36,first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second,The War of the Worlds,1750
36,cylinder under cover of a metal shield.,The War of the Worlds,1751
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1752
36,Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first,The War of the Worlds,1753
36,of the fighting-machines I had seen.  The gun he drove had been,The War of the Worlds,1754
36,"unlimbered near Horsell, in order to command the sand pits, and its",The War of the Worlds,1755
36,arrival it was that had precipitated the action.  As the limber,The War of the Worlds,1756
36,"gunners went to the rear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came",The War of the Worlds,1757
36,"down, throwing him into a depression of the ground.  At the same",The War of the Worlds,1758
36,"moment the gun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew up, there was",The War of the Worlds,1759
36,"fire all about him, and he found himself lying under a heap of charred",The War of the Worlds,1760
36,dead men and dead horses.,The War of the Worlds,1761
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1762
36,"""I lay still,"" he said, ""scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter",The War of the Worlds,1763
36,of a horse atop of me.  We'd been wiped out.  And the smell--good,The War of the Worlds,1764
36,God!  Like burnt meat!  I was hurt across the back by the fall of,The War of the Worlds,1765
36,"the horse, and there I had to lie until I felt better.  Just like",The War of the Worlds,1766
36,"parade it had been a minute before--then stumble, bang, swish!""",The War of the Worlds,1767
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1768
36,"""Wiped out!"" he said.",The War of the Worlds,1769
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1770
36,"He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out",The War of the Worlds,1771
36,"furtively across the common.  The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in",The War of the Worlds,1772
36,"skirmishing order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence.",The War of the Worlds,1773
36,Then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely,The War of the Worlds,1774
36,"to and fro across the common among the few fugitives, with its",The War of the Worlds,1775
36,headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human,The War of the Worlds,1776
36,"being.  A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which",The War of the Worlds,1777
36,"green flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked",The War of the Worlds,1778
36,the Heat-Ray.,The War of the Worlds,1779
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1780
36,"In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a",The War of the Worlds,1781
36,"living thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it",The War of the Worlds,1782
36,that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning.  The hussars,The War of the Worlds,1783
36,"had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw",The War of the Worlds,1784
36,nothing of them.  He heard the Maxims rattle for a time and then,The War of the Worlds,1785
36,become still.  The giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses,The War of the Worlds,1786
36,"until the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and",The War of the Worlds,1787
36,the town became a heap of fiery ruins.  Then the Thing shut off the,The War of the Worlds,1788
36,"Heat-Ray, and turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle",The War of the Worlds,1789
36,away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second,The War of the Worlds,1790
36,cylinder.  As it did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out,The War of the Worlds,1791
36,of the pit.,The War of the Worlds,1792
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1793
36,"The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman",The War of the Worlds,1794
36,began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards,The War of the Worlds,1795
36,Horsell.  He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the,The War of the Worlds,1796
36,"road, and so escaped to Woking.  There his story became ejaculatory.",The War of the Worlds,1797
36,The place was impassable.  It seems there were a few people alive,The War of the Worlds,1798
36,"there, frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded.  He was",The War of the Worlds,1799
36,"turned aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of",The War of the Worlds,1800
36,broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned.  He saw this one,The War of the Worlds,1801
36,"pursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock",The War of the Worlds,1802
36,"his head against the trunk of a pine tree.  At last, after nightfall,",The War of the Worlds,1803
36,the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway,The War of the Worlds,1804
36,embankment.,The War of the Worlds,1805
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1806
36,"Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope",The War of the Worlds,1807
36,of getting out of danger Londonward.  People were hiding in trenches,The War of the Worlds,1808
36,"and cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking",The War of the Worlds,1809
36,village and Send.  He had been consumed with thirst until he found one,The War of the Worlds,1810
36,"of the water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water",The War of the Worlds,1811
36,bubbling out like a spring upon the road.,The War of the Worlds,1812
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1813
36,"That was the story I got from him, bit by bit.  He grew calmer",The War of the Worlds,1814
36,telling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen.  He had,The War of the Worlds,1815
36,"eaten no food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I",The War of the Worlds,1816
36,found some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the,The War of the Worlds,1817
36,"room.  We lit no lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever",The War of the Worlds,1818
36,"and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat.  As he talked,",The War of the Worlds,1819
36,"things about us came darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled",The War of the Worlds,1820
36,bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct.  It,The War of the Worlds,1821
36,would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn.,The War of the Worlds,1822
36,"I began to see his face, blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was",The War of the Worlds,1823
36,also.,The War of the Worlds,1824
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1825
36,"When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study,",The War of the Worlds,1826
36,and I looked again out of the open window.  In one night the valley,The War of the Worlds,1827
36,had become a valley of ashes.  The fires had dwindled now.  Where,The War of the Worlds,1828
36,flames had been there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless,The War of the Worlds,1829
36,ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees,The War of the Worlds,1830
36,that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the,The War of the Worlds,1831
36,pitiless light of dawn.  Yet here and there some object had had the,The War of the Worlds,1832
36,"luck to escape--a white railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse",The War of the Worlds,1833
36,"there, white and fresh amid the wreckage.  Never before in the history",The War of the Worlds,1834
36,of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal.,The War of the Worlds,1835
36,"And shining with the growing light of the east, three of the metallic",The War of the Worlds,1836
36,"giants stood about the pit, their cowls rotating as though they were",The War of the Worlds,1837
36,surveying the desolation they had made.,The War of the Worlds,1838
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1839
36,"It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again",The War of the Worlds,1840
36,puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the,The War of the Worlds,1841
36,"brightening dawn--streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished.",The War of the Worlds,1842
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1843
36,Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham.  They became pillars,The War of the Worlds,1844
36,of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day.,The War of the Worlds,1845

36,"",The War of the Worlds,1852
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1853
36,As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we,The War of the Worlds,1854
36,"had watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.",The War of the Worlds,1855
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1856
36,The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay,The War of the Worlds,1857
36,"in.  He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence",The War of the Worlds,1858
36,"rejoin his battery--No. 12, of the Horse Artillery.  My plan was to",The War of the Worlds,1859
36,return at once to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the,The War of the Worlds,1860
36,Martians impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to,The War of the Worlds,1861
36,"Newhaven, and go with her out of the country forthwith.  For I already",The War of the Worlds,1862
36,perceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably be the,The War of the Worlds,1863
36,scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be,The War of the Worlds,1864
36,destroyed.,The War of the Worlds,1865
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1866
36,"Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with",The War of the Worlds,1867
36,"its guarding giants.  Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my",The War of the Worlds,1868
36,chance and struck across country.  But the artilleryman dissuaded me:,The War of the Worlds,1869
36,"""It's no kindness to the right sort of wife,"" he said, ""to make her a",The War of the Worlds,1870
36,"widow""; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the",The War of the Worlds,1871
36,"woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him.",The War of the Worlds,1872
36,Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.,The War of the Worlds,1873
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1874
36,"I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active",The War of the Worlds,1875
36,service and he knew better than that.  He made me ransack the house,The War of the Worlds,1876
36,"for a flask, which he filled with whiskey; and we lined every",The War of the Worlds,1877
36,available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat.  Then,The War of the Worlds,1878
36,"we crept out of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the",The War of the Worlds,1879
36,ill-made road by which I had come overnight.  The houses seemed,The War of the Worlds,1880
36,deserted. In the road lay a group of three charred bodies close,The War of the Worlds,1881
36,"together, struck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were things",The War of the Worlds,1882
36,"that people had dropped--a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the",The War of the Worlds,1883
36,like poor valuables.  At the corner turning up towards the post,The War of the Worlds,1884
36,"office a little cart, filled with boxes and furniture, and horseless,",The War of the Worlds,1885
36,heeled over on a broken wheel.  A cash box had been hastily smashed,The War of the Worlds,1886
36,open and thrown under the debris.,The War of the Worlds,1887
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1888
36,"Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of",The War of the Worlds,1889
36,the houses had suffered very greatly here.  The Heat-Ray had shaved,The War of the Worlds,1890
36,"the chimney tops and passed.  Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem",The War of the Worlds,1891
36,to be a living soul on Maybury Hill.  The majority of the inhabitants,The War of the Worlds,1892
36,"had escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road--the road I had",The War of the Worlds,1893
36,taken when I drove to Leatherhead--or they had hidden.,The War of the Worlds,1894
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1895
36,"We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now",The War of the Worlds,1896
36,"from the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the",The War of the Worlds,1897
36,hill.  We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a,The War of the Worlds,1898
36,soul.  The woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened,The War of the Worlds,1899
36,"ruins of woods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain",The War of the Worlds,1900
36,"proportion still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage",The War of the Worlds,1901
36,instead of green.,The War of the Worlds,1902
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1903
36,On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees;,The War of the Worlds,1904
36,it had failed to secure its footing.  In one place the woodmen had,The War of the Worlds,1905
36,"been at work on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a",The War of the Worlds,1906
36,"clearing, with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine.",The War of the Worlds,1907
36,"Hard by was a temporary hut, deserted.  There was not a breath of wind",The War of the Worlds,1908
36,"this morning, and everything was strangely still.  Even the birds were",The War of the Worlds,1909
36,"hushed, and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in",The War of the Worlds,1910
36,whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders.  Once or twice,The War of the Worlds,1911
36,we stopped to listen.,The War of the Worlds,1912
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1913
36,"After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the",The War of the Worlds,1914
36,clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers,The War of the Worlds,1915
36,"riding slowly towards Woking.  We hailed them, and they halted while",The War of the Worlds,1916
36,we hurried towards them.  It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates,The War of the Worlds,1917
36,"of the 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the",The War of the Worlds,1918
36,artilleryman told me was a heliograph.,The War of the Worlds,1919
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1920

36,"said the lieutenant.  ""What's brewing?""",The War of the Worlds,1922
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1923
36,His voice and face were eager.  The men behind him stared,The War of the Worlds,1924
36,curiously.  The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and,The War of the Worlds,1925
36,saluted.,The War of the Worlds,1926
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1927
36,"""Gun destroyed last night, sir.  Have been hiding.  Trying to",The War of the Worlds,1928

36,"about half a mile along this road.""",The War of the Worlds,1930
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1931

36,"Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at",The War of the Worlds,1945
36,me.  I was still standing on the bank by the side of the road.,The War of the Worlds,1946
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1947
36,"""It's perfectly true,"" I said.",The War of the Worlds,1948
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1949

36,"too.  Look here""--to the artilleryman--""we're detailed here clearing",The War of the Worlds,1951

36,"Weybridge.  Know the way?""",The War of the Worlds,1954
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1955

36,"""Half a mile, you say?"" said he.",The War of the Worlds,1958
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1959
36,"""At most,"" I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward.  He",The War of the Worlds,1960

36,"",The War of the Worlds,1962
36,Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children,The War of the Worlds,1963
36,"in the road, busy clearing out a labourer's cottage.  They had",The War of the Worlds,1964
36,"got hold of a little hand truck, and were piling it up with",The War of the Worlds,1965
36,unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture.  They were all too,The War of the Worlds,1966
36,assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed.,The War of the Worlds,1967
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1968
36,"By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the",The War of the Worlds,1969

36,"silent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement of",The War of the Worlds,1972
36,"packing in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge",The War of the Worlds,1973
36,"over the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day",The War of the Worlds,1974

36,"a stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal",The War of the Worlds,1979

36,"Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a",The War of the Worlds,1990
36,"number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and",The War of the Worlds,1991
36,more guns behind.,The War of the Worlds,1992
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1993
36,"""It's bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,"" said the",The War of the Worlds,1994
36,"artilleryman.  ""They 'aven't seen that fire-beam yet.""",The War of the Worlds,1995
36,"",The War of the Worlds,1996
36,The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over,The War of the Worlds,1997
36,"the treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now",The War of the Worlds,1998
36,and again to stare in the same direction.,The War of the Worlds,1999
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2000
36,"Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars,",The War of the Worlds,2001
36,"some of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about.",The War of the Worlds,2002
36,"Three or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles,",The War of the Worlds,2003
36,"and an old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the",The War of the Worlds,2004
36,"village street.  There were scores of people, most of them",The War of the Worlds,2005
36,sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes.  The,The War of the Worlds,2006
36,soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise,The War of the Worlds,2007
36,the gravity of their position.  We saw one shrivelled old fellow with,The War of the Worlds,2008
36,"a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids,",The War of the Worlds,2009
36,angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind.,The War of the Worlds,2010
36,I stopped and gripped his arm.,The War of the Worlds,2011
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2012
36,"""Do you know what's over there?"" I said, pointing at the pine tops",The War of the Worlds,2013
36,that hid the Martians.,The War of the Worlds,2014
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2015
36,"""Eh?"" said he, turning.  ""I was explainin' these is vallyble.""",The War of the Worlds,2016
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2017
36,"""Death!"" I shouted.  ""Death is coming!  Death!"" and leaving him to",The War of the Worlds,2018
36,"digest that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man.  At the",The War of the Worlds,2019
36,"corner I looked back.  The soldier had left him, and he was still",The War of the Worlds,2020
36,"standing by his box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and",The War of the Worlds,2021
36,staring vaguely over the trees.,The War of the Worlds,2022
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2023
36,No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were,The War of the Worlds,2024
36,established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen,The War of the Worlds,2025
36,"in any town before.  Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing",The War of the Worlds,2026
36,miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh.  The respectable inhabitants,The War of the Worlds,2027
36,"of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily",The War of the Worlds,2028
36,"dressed, were packing, river-side loafers energetically helping,",The War of the Worlds,2029
36,"children excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this",The War of the Worlds,2030
36,astonishing variation of their Sunday experiences.  In the midst of it,The War of the Worlds,2031
36,"all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration,",The War of the Worlds,2032
36,and his bell was jangling out above the excitement.,The War of the Worlds,2033
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2034
36,"I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking",The War of the Worlds,2035
36,"fountain, made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with",The War of the Worlds,2036
36,"us. Patrols of soldiers--here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in",The War of the Worlds,2037
36,white--were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their,The War of the Worlds,2038
36,cellars as soon as the firing began.  We saw as we crossed the,The War of the Worlds,2039
36,railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and,The War of the Worlds,2040
36,"about the railway station, and the swarming platform was piled with",The War of the Worlds,2041
36,"boxes and packages. The ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe,",The War of the Worlds,2042
36,"in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey, and",The War of the Worlds,2043
36,I have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the,The War of the Worlds,2044
36,special trains that were put on at a later hour.,The War of the Worlds,2045
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2046
36,"We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found",The War of the Worlds,2047
36,ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames,The War of the Worlds,2048
36,join.  Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a,The War of the Worlds,2049
36,"little cart.  The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are",The War of the Worlds,2050
36,"to be hired, and there was a ferry across the river.  On the",The War of the Worlds,2051
36,"Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of",The War of the Worlds,2052
36,Shepperton Church--it has been replaced by a spire--rose above the,The War of the Worlds,2053
36,trees.,The War of the Worlds,2054
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2055
36,Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives.  As yet the,The War of the Worlds,2056
36,"flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more",The War of the Worlds,2057
36,people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross.,The War of the Worlds,2058
36,People came panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife,The War of the Worlds,2059
36,"were even carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of",The War of the Worlds,2060
36,their household goods piled thereon.  One man told us he meant to try,The War of the Worlds,2061
36,to get away from Shepperton station.,The War of the Worlds,2062
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2063
36,"There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting.  The idea",The War of the Worlds,2064
36,people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply,The War of the Worlds,2065
36,"formidable human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be",The War of the Worlds,2066
36,certainly destroyed in the end.  Every now and then people would,The War of the Worlds,2067
36,"glance nervously across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but",The War of the Worlds,2068
36,everything over there was still.,The War of the Worlds,2069
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2070
36,"Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything",The War of the Worlds,2071
36,"was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side.  The people who",The War of the Worlds,2072
36,landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane.  The big,The War of the Worlds,2073
36,ferryboat had just made a journey.  Three or four soldiers stood on,The War of the Worlds,2074
36,"the lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without",The War of the Worlds,2075
36,"offering to help.  The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited",The War of the Worlds,2076
36,hours.,The War of the Worlds,2077
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2078
36,"""What's that?"" cried a boatman, and ""Shut up, you fool!"" said a man",The War of the Worlds,2079
36,"near me to a yelping dog.  Then the sound came again, this time from",The War of the Worlds,2080
36,"the direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud--the sound of a gun.",The War of the Worlds,2081
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2082
36,The fighting was beginning.  Almost immediately unseen batteries,The War of the Worlds,2083
36,"across the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up",The War of the Worlds,2084
36,"the chorus, firing heavily one after the other.  A woman screamed.",The War of the Worlds,2085
36,"Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet",The War of the Worlds,2086
36,"invisible to us.  Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows",The War of the Worlds,2087
36,"feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows",The War of the Worlds,2088
36,motionless in the warm sunlight.,The War of the Worlds,2089
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2090
36,"""The sojers'll stop 'em,"" said a woman beside me, doubtfully.  A",The War of the Worlds,2091
36,haziness rose over the treetops.,The War of the Worlds,2092
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2093
36,"Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff",The War of the Worlds,2094
36,of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the,The War of the Worlds,2095
36,"ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing",The War of the Worlds,2096
36,"two or three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.",The War of the Worlds,2097
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2098
36,"""Here they are!"" shouted a man in a blue jersey.  ""Yonder! D'yer",The War of the Worlds,2099
36,"see them?  Yonder!""",The War of the Worlds,2100
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2101
36,"Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured",The War of the Worlds,2102
36,"Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat",The War of the Worlds,2103
36,"meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly",The War of the Worlds,2104
36,"towards the river.  Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going",The War of the Worlds,2105
36,with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds.,The War of the Worlds,2106
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2107
36,"Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth.  Their armoured",The War of the Worlds,2108
36,bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the,The War of the Worlds,2109
36,"guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer.  One on the extreme",The War of the Worlds,2110
36,"left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air,",The War of the Worlds,2111
36,"and the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night",The War of the Worlds,2112
36,"smote towards Chertsey, and struck the town.",The War of the Worlds,2113
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2114
36,"At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd",The War of the Worlds,2115
36,near the water's edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck.,The War of the Worlds,2116
36,"There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence.  Then a hoarse",The War of the Worlds,2117
36,"murmur and a movement of feet--a splashing from the water.  A man, too",The War of the Worlds,2118
36,"frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung",The War of the Worlds,2119
36,round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his,The War of the Worlds,2120
36,burden.  A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me.  I,The War of the Worlds,2121
36,"turned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified for",The War of the Worlds,2122
36,thought.  The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind.  To get under water!,The War of the Worlds,2123
36,That was it!,The War of the Worlds,2124
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2125
36,"""Get under water!"" I shouted, unheeded.",The War of the Worlds,2126
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2127
36,"I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian,",The War of the Worlds,2128
36,rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water.,The War of the Worlds,2129
36,Others did the same.  A boatload of people putting back came leaping,The War of the Worlds,2130
36,out as I rushed past.  The stones under my feet were muddy and,The War of the Worlds,2131
36,"slippery, and the river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet",The War of the Worlds,2132
36,"scarcely waist-deep.  Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely",The War of the Worlds,2133
36,"a couple of hundred yards away, I flung myself forward under the",The War of the Worlds,2134
36,surface.  The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the,The War of the Worlds,2135
36,river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears.  People were landing,The War of the Worlds,2136
36,hastily on both sides of the river.  But the Martian machine took no,The War of the Worlds,2137
36,more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that,The War of the Worlds,2138
36,than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his,The War of the Worlds,2139
36,"foot has kicked.  When, half suffocated, I raised my head above water,",The War of the Worlds,2140
36,the Martian's hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing,The War of the Worlds,2141
36,"across the river, and as it advanced it swung loose what must have",The War of the Worlds,2142
36,been the generator of the Heat-Ray.,The War of the Worlds,2143
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2144
36,"In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading",The War of the Worlds,2145
36,halfway across.  The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther,The War of the Worlds,2146
36,"bank, and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height",The War of the Worlds,2147
36,"again, close to the village of Shepperton.  Forthwith the six guns",The War of the Worlds,2148
36,"which, unknown to anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the",The War of the Worlds,2149
36,"outskirts of that village, fired simultaneously.  The sudden near",The War of the Worlds,2150
36,"concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump.  The",The War of the Worlds,2151
36,monster was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the,The War of the Worlds,2152
36,first shell burst six yards above the hood.,The War of the Worlds,2153
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2154
36,I gave a cry of astonishment.  I saw and thought nothing of the,The War of the Worlds,2155
36,other four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer,The War of the Worlds,2156
36,incident.  Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the,The War of the Worlds,2157
36,"body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to",The War of the Worlds,2158
36,"dodge, the fourth shell.",The War of the Worlds,2159
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2160
36,"The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing.  The hood bulged,",The War of the Worlds,2161
36,"flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh",The War of the Worlds,2162
36,and glittering metal.,The War of the Worlds,2163
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2164
36,"""Hit!"" shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer.",The War of the Worlds,2165
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2166
36,I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me.  I,The War of the Worlds,2167
36,could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.,The War of the Worlds,2168
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2169
36,The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did,The War of the Worlds,2170
36,"not fall over.  It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer",The War of the Worlds,2171
36,heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now,The War of the Worlds,2172
36,"rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton.  The living",The War of the Worlds,2173
36,"intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to",The War of the Worlds,2174
36,"the four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricate",The War of the Worlds,2175
36,device of metal whirling to destruction.  It drove along in a straight,The War of the Worlds,2176
36,"line, incapable of guidance.  It struck the tower of Shepperton",The War of the Worlds,2177
36,"Church, smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have",The War of the Worlds,2178
36,"done, swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force",The War of the Worlds,2179
36,into the river out of my sight.,The War of the Worlds,2180
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2181
36,"A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam,",The War of the Worlds,2182
36,"mud, and shattered metal shot far up into the sky.  As the camera of",The War of the Worlds,2183
36,"the Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into",The War of the Worlds,2184
36,"steam.  In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but",The War of the Worlds,2185
36,"almost scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream.  I saw",The War of the Worlds,2186
36,"people struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting",The War of the Worlds,2187
36,faintly above the seething and roar of the Martian's collapse.,The War of the Worlds,2188
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2189
36,"For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need",The War of the Worlds,2190
36,"of self-preservation.  I splashed through the tumultuous water,",The War of the Worlds,2191
36,"pushing aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the",The War of the Worlds,2192
36,bend.  Half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the,The War of the Worlds,2193
36,confusion of the waves.  The fallen Martian came into sight,The War of the Worlds,2194
36,"downstream, lying across the river, and for the most part submerged.",The War of the Worlds,2195
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2196
36,"Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through",The War of the Worlds,2197
36,"the tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently and",The War of the Worlds,2198
36,"vaguely, the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash",The War of the Worlds,2199
36,and spray of mud and froth into the air.  The tentacles swayed and,The War of the Worlds,2200
36,"struck like living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of",The War of the Worlds,2201
36,"these movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for",The War of the Worlds,2202
36,its life amid the waves.  Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid,The War of the Worlds,2203
36,were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine.,The War of the Worlds,2204
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2205
36,My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious,The War of the Worlds,2206
36,"yelling, like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing",The War of the Worlds,2207
36,"towns.  A man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me",The War of the Worlds,2208
36,"and pointed.  Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with",The War of the Worlds,2209
36,gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey.,The War of the Worlds,2210
36,The Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly.,The War of the Worlds,2211
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2212
36,"At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until",The War of the Worlds,2213
36,"movement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as",The War of the Worlds,2214
36,"long as I could.  The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly",The War of the Worlds,2215
36,growing hotter.,The War of the Worlds,2216
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2217
36,When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the,The War of the Worlds,2218
36,"hair and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white",The War of the Worlds,2219
36,fog that at first hid the Martians altogether.  The noise was,The War of the Worlds,2220
36,"deafening.  Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified",The War of the Worlds,2221
36,"by the mist.  They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the",The War of the Worlds,2222
36,"frothing, tumultuous ruins of their comrade.",The War of the Worlds,2223
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2224
36,"The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two",The War of the Worlds,2225
36,"hundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham.  The generators of",The War of the Worlds,2226
36,"the Heat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way",The War of the Worlds,2227
36,and that.,The War of the Worlds,2228
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2229
36,"The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of",The War of the Worlds,2230
36,"noises--the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling",The War of the Worlds,2231
36,"houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the",The War of the Worlds,2232
36,crackling and roaring of fire.  Dense black smoke was leaping up to,The War of the Worlds,2233
36,"mingle with the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and",The War of the Worlds,2234
36,fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent,The War of the Worlds,2235
36,"white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames.  The",The War of the Worlds,2236
36,"nearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint",The War of the Worlds,2237
36,"and pallid in the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.",The War of the Worlds,2238
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2239
36,"For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost",The War of the Worlds,2240
36,"boiling water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape.  Through",The War of the Worlds,2241
36,the reek I could see the people who had been with me in the river,The War of the Worlds,2242
36,"scrambling out of the water through the reeds, like little frogs",The War of the Worlds,2243
36,"hurrying through grass from the advance of a man, or running to and",The War of the Worlds,2244
36,fro in utter dismay on the towing path.,The War of the Worlds,2245
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2246
36,Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping,The War of the Worlds,2247
36,"towards me.  The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and",The War of the Worlds,2248
36,darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar.  The Ray,The War of the Worlds,2249
36,"flickered up and down the towing path, licking off the people who ran",The War of the Worlds,2250
36,"this way and that, and came down to the water's edge not fifty yards",The War of the Worlds,2251
36,"from where I stood.  It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the",The War of the Worlds,2252
36,water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam.  I,The War of the Worlds,2253
36,turned shoreward.,The War of the Worlds,2254
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2255
36,"In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had",The War of the Worlds,2256
36,"rushed upon me.  I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded,",The War of the Worlds,2257
36,"agonised, I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the",The War of the Worlds,2258
36,"shore.  Had my foot stumbled, it would have been the end.  I fell",The War of the Worlds,2259

36,"",The War of the Worlds,2278
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2279
36,After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial,The War of the Worlds,2280
36,"weapons, the Martians retreated to their original position upon",The War of the Worlds,2281
36,"Horsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of",The War of the Worlds,2282
36,"their smashed companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray",The War of the Worlds,2283
36,and negligible victim as myself.  Had they left their comrade and,The War of the Worlds,2284
36,"pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that time between them and",The War of the Worlds,2285
36,"London but batteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly",The War of the Worlds,2286
36,have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach;,The War of the Worlds,2287
36,"as sudden, dreadful, and destructive their advent would have been as",The War of the Worlds,2288
36,the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon a century ago.,The War of the Worlds,2289
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2290
36,But they were in no hurry.  Cylinder followed cylinder on its,The War of the Worlds,2291
36,interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them,The War of the Worlds,2292
36,"reinforcement.  And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now",The War of the Worlds,2293
36,"fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with",The War of the Worlds,2294
36,"furious energy.  Every minute a fresh gun came into position until,",The War of the Worlds,2295
36,"before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the",The War of the Worlds,2296
36,"hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black",The War of the Worlds,2297
36,muzzle.  And through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twenty,The War of the Worlds,2298
36,square miles altogether--that encircled the Martian encampment on,The War of the Worlds,2299
36,"Horsell Common, through charred and ruined villages among the green",The War of the Worlds,2300
36,"trees, through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a",The War of the Worlds,2301
36,"day ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs",The War of the Worlds,2302
36,that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach.  But,The War of the Worlds,2303
36,the Martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of,The War of the Worlds,2304
36,"human proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either",The War of the Worlds,2305
36,"cylinder, save at the price of his life.",The War of the Worlds,2306
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2307
36,It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the,The War of the Worlds,2308
36,"afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second",The War of the Worlds,2309
36,and third cylinders--the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third,The War of the Worlds,2310
36,"at Pyrford--to their original pit on Horsell Common.  Over that, above",The War of the Worlds,2311
36,the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and,The War of the Worlds,2312
36,"wide, stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast",The War of the Worlds,2313
36,fighting-machines and descended into the pit.  They were hard at work,The War of the Worlds,2314
36,"there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke",The War of the Worlds,2315
36,"that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and",The War of the Worlds,2316
36,"even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs.",The War of the Worlds,2317
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2318
36,And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next,The War of the Worlds,2319
36,"sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my",The War of the Worlds,2320
36,way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning,The War of the Worlds,2321
36,Weybridge towards London.,The War of the Worlds,2322
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2323
36,"I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream;",The War of the Worlds,2324
36,"and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it,",The War of the Worlds,2325
36,"gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction.  There were no",The War of the Worlds,2326
36,"oars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled",The War of the Worlds,2327
36,"hands would allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going",The War of the Worlds,2328
36,"very tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well",The War of the Worlds,2329
36,"understand.  I followed the river, because I considered that the water",The War of the Worlds,2330
36,gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.,The War of the Worlds,2331
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2332
36,The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream with,The War of the Worlds,2333
36,"me, so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either",The War of the Worlds,2334
36,"bank.  Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying",The War of the Worlds,2335
36,"across the meadows from the direction of Weybridge.  Halliford, it",The War of the Worlds,2336
36,"seemed, was deserted, and several of the houses facing the river were",The War of the Worlds,2337
36,"on fire.  It was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite",The War of the Worlds,2338
36,"desolate under the hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of",The War of the Worlds,2339
36,flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon.  Never before,The War of the Worlds,2340
36,had I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive,The War of the Worlds,2341
36,crowd.  A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and,The War of the Worlds,2342
36,"glowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late",The War of the Worlds,2343
36,field of hay.,The War of the Worlds,2344
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2345
36,"For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the",The War of the Worlds,2346
36,"violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water.",The War of the Worlds,2347
36,"Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling.",The War of the Worlds,2348
36,"The sun scorched my bare back.  At last, as the bridge at Walton was",The War of the Worlds,2349
36,"coming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my",The War of the Worlds,2350
36,"fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick,",The War of the Worlds,2351
36,amid the long grass.  I suppose the time was then about four or five,The War of the Worlds,2352
36,"o'clock.  I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without",The War of the Worlds,2353
36,"meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge.  I",The War of the Worlds,2354
36,"seem to remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last",The War of the Worlds,2355
36,"spurt.  I was also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no",The War of the Worlds,2356
36,more water.  It is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I,The War of the Worlds,2357
36,"cannot account for it, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead",The War of the Worlds,2358
36,worried me excessively.,The War of the Worlds,2359
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2360
36,"I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably",The War of the Worlds,2361
36,I dozed.  I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged,The War of the Worlds,2362
36,"shirt sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring at",The War of the Worlds,2363
36,a faint flickering that danced over the sky.  The sky was what is,The War of the Worlds,2364
36,called a mackerel sky--rows and rows of faint down-plumes of,The War of the Worlds,2365
36,"cloud, just tinted with the midsummer sunset.",The War of the Worlds,2366
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2367
36,"I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly.",The War of the Worlds,2368
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2369
36,"""Have you any water?"" I asked abruptly.",The War of the Worlds,2370

36,"",The War of the Worlds,2375
36,"For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other.  I",The War of the Worlds,2376
36,"dare say he found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my",The War of the Worlds,2377
36,"water-soaked trousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders",The War of the Worlds,2378
36,"blackened by the smoke.  His face was a fair weakness, his chin",The War of the Worlds,2379
36,"retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low",The War of the Worlds,2380
36,"forehead; his eyes were rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring.",The War of the Worlds,2381
36,"He spoke abruptly, looking vacantly away from me.",The War of the Worlds,2382

36,through Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford.  They were busy,The War of the Worlds,2551
36,making the necessary arrangements to alter the route of the,The War of the Worlds,2552
36,Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday League excursions.  A nocturnal,The War of the Worlds,2553
36,"newspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the traffic manager, to",The War of the Worlds,2554
36,"whom he bears a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interview",The War of the Worlds,2555
36,"him.  Few people, excepting the railway officials, connected the",The War of the Worlds,2556
36,breakdown with the Martians.,The War of the Worlds,2557
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2558
36,"I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday",The War of the Worlds,2559
36,"morning ""all London was electrified by the news from Woking.""  As a",The War of the Worlds,2560
36,"matter of fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant",The War of the Worlds,2561
36,phrase.  Plenty of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the,The War of the Worlds,2562
36,panic of Monday morning.  Those who did took some time to realise all,The War of the Worlds,2563
36,that the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed.  The,The War of the Worlds,2564
36,majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers.,The War of the Worlds,2565
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2566
36,"The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the",The War of the Worlds,2567
36,"Londoner's mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course",The War of the Worlds,2568
36,"in the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors:",The War of the Worlds,2569
36,"""About seven o'clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder,",The War of the Worlds,2570
36,"and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely",The War of the Worlds,2571

36,entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment.  No details are known.,The War of the Worlds,2573
36,Maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field,The War of the Worlds,2574
36,guns have been disabled by them.  Flying hussars have been galloping,The War of the Worlds,2575
36,into Chertsey.  The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards,The War of the Worlds,2576
36,"Chertsey or Windsor.  Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and",The War of the Worlds,2577
36,"earthworks are being thrown up to check the advance Londonward.""  That",The War of the Worlds,2578
36,"was how the Sunday _Sun_ put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt",The War of the Worlds,2579

36,suddenly let loose in a village.,The War of the Worlds,2581
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2582
36,No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured,The War of the Worlds,2583
36,"Martians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be",The War of the Worlds,2584
36,"sluggish: ""crawling,"" ""creeping painfully""--such expressions occurred",The War of the Worlds,2585
36,in almost all the earlier reports.  None of the telegrams could have,The War of the Worlds,2586
36,been written by an eyewitness of their advance.  The Sunday papers,The War of the Worlds,2587
36,"printed separate editions as further news came to hand, some even in",The War of the Worlds,2588
36,default of it.  But there was practically nothing more to tell people,The War of the Worlds,2589
36,"until late in the afternoon, when the authorities gave the press",The War of the Worlds,2590
36,agencies the news in their possession.  It was stated that the people,The War of the Worlds,2591
36,"of Walton and Weybridge, and all the district were pouring along the",The War of the Worlds,2592
36,"roads Londonward, and that was all.",The War of the Worlds,2593
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2594
36,"My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning,",The War of the Worlds,2595
36,still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night.  There,The War of the Worlds,2596
36,"he heard allusions made to the invasion, and a special prayer for",The War of the Worlds,2597
36,"peace.  Coming out, he bought a _Referee_.  He became alarmed at the",The War of the Worlds,2598
36,"news in this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if",The War of the Worlds,2599
36,"communication were restored.  The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and",The War of the Worlds,2600
36,innumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely,The War of the Worlds,2601
36,affected by the strange intelligence that the news venders were,The War of the Worlds,2602
36,"disseminating.  People were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only",The War of the Worlds,2603
36,on account of the local residents.  At the station he heard for the,The War of the Worlds,2604
36,first time that the Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted.,The War of the Worlds,2605
36,The porters told him that several remarkable telegrams had been,The War of the Worlds,2606
36,"received in the morning from Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but that",The War of the Worlds,2607
36,these had abruptly ceased.  My brother could get very little precise,The War of the Worlds,2608
36,detail out of them.,The War of the Worlds,2609
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2610
36,"""There's fighting going on about Weybridge"" was the extent of their",The War of the Worlds,2611
36,information.,The War of the Worlds,2612
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2613
36,The train service was now very much disorganised.  Quite a number,The War of the Worlds,2614
36,of people who had been expecting friends from places on the,The War of the Worlds,2615
36,South-Western network were standing about the station.  One,The War of the Worlds,2616
36,grey-headed old gentleman came and abused the South-Western Company,The War of the Worlds,2617
36,"bitterly to my brother.  ""It wants showing up,"" he said.",The War of the Worlds,2618
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2619
36,"One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston,",The War of the Worlds,2620
36,containing people who had gone out for a day's boating and found the,The War of the Worlds,2621
36,locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air.  A man in a blue and,The War of the Worlds,2622
36,"white blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings.",The War of the Worlds,2623
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2624
36,"""There's hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts",The War of the Worlds,2625
36,"and things, with boxes of valuables and all that,"" he said.  ""They",The War of the Worlds,2626
36,"come from Molesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there's been",The War of the Worlds,2627
36,"guns heard at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have",The War of the Worlds,2628
36,told them to get off at once because the Martians are coming.  We,The War of the Worlds,2629
36,"heard guns firing at Hampton Court station, but we thought it was",The War of the Worlds,2630
36,thunder.  What the dickens does it all mean?  The Martians can't get,The War of the Worlds,2631
36,"out of their pit, can they?""",The War of the Worlds,2632

36,Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to,The War of the Worlds,2636
36,"the clients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday",The War of the Worlds,2637
36,excursionists began to return from all over the South-Western,The War of the Worlds,2638
36,"""lung""--Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth--at",The War of the Worlds,2639
36,unnaturally early hours; but not a soul had anything more than vague,The War of the Worlds,2640
36,hearsay to tell of.  Everyone connected with the terminus seemed,The War of the Worlds,2641
36,ill-tempered.,The War of the Worlds,2642
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2643
36,About five o'clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely,The War of the Worlds,2644
36,"excited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almost",The War of the Worlds,2645
36,"invariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western",The War of the Worlds,2646
36,"stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and",The War of the Worlds,2647
36,carriages crammed with soldiers.  These were the guns that were,The War of the Worlds,2648
36,brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston.  There was,The War of the Worlds,2649
36,"an exchange of pleasantries: ""You'll get eaten!""  ""We're the",The War of the Worlds,2650
36,"beast-tamers!"" and so forth.  A little while after that a squad of",The War of the Worlds,2651
36,police came into the station and began to clear the public off the,The War of the Worlds,2652
36,"platforms, and my brother went out into the street again.",The War of the Worlds,2653
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2654
36,"The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of",The War of the Worlds,2655
36,Salvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road.  On the bridge,The War of the Worlds,2656
36,a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came,The War of the Worlds,2657
36,"drifting down the stream in patches.  The sun was just setting, and the",The War of the Worlds,2658
36,Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most,The War of the Worlds,2659
36,"peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with",The War of the Worlds,2660
36,long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud.  There was talk of a,The War of the Worlds,2661
36,"floating body.  One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told",The War of the Worlds,2662
36,my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west.,The War of the Worlds,2663
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2664
36,In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who,The War of the Worlds,2665
36,had just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and,The War of the Worlds,2666
36,"staring placards.  ""Dreadful catastrophe!"" they bawled one to the",The War of the Worlds,2667
36,"other down Wellington Street.  ""Fighting at Weybridge!  Full",The War of the Worlds,2668
36,"description!  Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!""  He had to",The War of the Worlds,2669
36,give threepence for a copy of that paper.,The War of the Worlds,2670
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2671
36,"Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full",The War of the Worlds,2672
36,power and terror of these monsters.  He learned that they were not,The War of the Worlds,2673
36,"merely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds",The War of the Worlds,2674
36,swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and,The War of the Worlds,2675
36,smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand,The War of the Worlds,2676
36,against them.,The War of the Worlds,2677
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2678
36,"They were described as ""vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred",The War of the Worlds,2679
36,"feet high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot",The War of the Worlds,2680
36,"out a beam of intense heat.""  Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns,",The War of the Worlds,2681
36,"had been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially",The War of the Worlds,2682
36,between the Woking district and London.  Five of the machines had been,The War of the Worlds,2683
36,"seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been",The War of the Worlds,2684
36,"destroyed.  In the other cases the shells had missed, and the",The War of the Worlds,2685
36,batteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays.  Heavy,The War of the Worlds,2686
36,"losses of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was",The War of the Worlds,2687
36,optimistic.,The War of the Worlds,2688
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2689
36,The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable.  They,The War of the Worlds,2690
36,"had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle",The War of the Worlds,2691
36,about Woking.  Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon,The War of the Worlds,2692
36,"them from all sides.  Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor,",The War of the Worlds,2693
36,"Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich--even from the north; among others,",The War of the Worlds,2694
36,long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich.  Altogether one,The War of the Worlds,2695
36,"hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly",The War of the Worlds,2696
36,covering London.  Never before in England had there been such a vast,The War of the Worlds,2697
36,or rapid concentration of military material.,The War of the Worlds,2698
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2699
36,"Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed",The War of the Worlds,2700
36,"at once by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured and",The War of the Worlds,2701
36,"distributed.  No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the",The War of the Worlds,2702
36,"strangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to",The War of the Worlds,2703
36,avoid and discourage panic.  No doubt the Martians were strange and,The War of the Worlds,2704
36,"terrible in the extreme, but at the outside there could not be more",The War of the Worlds,2705
36,than twenty of them against our millions.,The War of the Worlds,2706
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2707
36,"The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the",The War of the Worlds,2708
36,"cylinders, that at the outside there could not be more than five in",The War of the Worlds,2709
36,each cylinder--fifteen altogether.  And one at least was disposed,The War of the Worlds,2710
36,of--perhaps more.  The public would be fairly warned of the approach,The War of the Worlds,2711
36,"of danger, and elaborate measures were being taken for the protection",The War of the Worlds,2712
36,"of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs.  And so, with",The War of the Worlds,2713
36,reiterated assurances of the safety of London and the ability of the,The War of the Worlds,2714
36,"authorities to cope with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation",The War of the Worlds,2715
36,closed.,The War of the Worlds,2716
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2717
36,This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was,The War of the Worlds,2718
36,"still wet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment.  It",The War of the Worlds,2719
36,"was curious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents",The War of the Worlds,2720
36,of the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place.,The War of the Worlds,2721
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2722
36,All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the,The War of the Worlds,2723
36,"pink sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the",The War of the Worlds,2724
36,voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers.  Men came,The War of the Worlds,2725
36,scrambling off buses to secure copies.  Certainly this news excited,The War of the Worlds,2726
36,"people intensely, whatever their previous apathy.  The shutters of a",The War of the Worlds,2727
36,"map shop in the Strand were being taken down, my brother said, and a",The War of the Worlds,2728
36,"man in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible",The War of the Worlds,2729
36,inside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass.,The War of the Worlds,2730
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2731
36,"Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his",The War of the Worlds,2732
36,"hand, my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey.  There",The War of the Worlds,2733
36,was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in,The War of the Worlds,2734
36,a cart such as greengrocers use.  He was driving from the direction of,The War of the Worlds,2735
36,Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five,The War of the Worlds,2736
36,"or six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles.",The War of the Worlds,2737
36,"The faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance",The War of the Worlds,2738
36,contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the,The War of the Worlds,2739
36,people on the omnibuses.  People in fashionable clothing peeped at,The War of the Worlds,2740
36,them out of cabs.  They stopped at the Square as if undecided which,The War of the Worlds,2741
36,"way to take, and finally turned eastward along the Strand.  Some way",The War of the Worlds,2742
36,"behind these came a man in workday clothes, riding one of those",The War of the Worlds,2743
36,old-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel.  He was dirty and,The War of the Worlds,2744
36,white in the face.,The War of the Worlds,2745
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2746
36,"My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of such",The War of the Worlds,2747
36,people.  He had a vague idea that he might see something of me.  He,The War of the Worlds,2748
36,noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic.  Some of,The War of the Worlds,2749
36,the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses.,The War of the Worlds,2750
36,"One was professing to have seen the Martians.  ""Boilers on stilts, I",The War of the Worlds,2751

36,animated by their strange experience.,The War of the Worlds,2753
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2754
36,Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with,The War of the Worlds,2755

36,"reading papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday",The War of the Worlds,2757
36,"visitors.  They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the",The War of the Worlds,2758
36,"roads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day.  My",The War of the Worlds,2759

36,"clouds of smoke to the south--nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming",The War of the Worlds,2770

36,"window, and dying away slowly in the distance.  Close on the rear of",The War of the Worlds,2824
36,"this came a couple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of",The War of the Worlds,2825
36,"flying vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, where",The War of the Worlds,2826
36,"the North-Western special trains were loading up, instead of coming",The War of the Worlds,2827
36,down the gradient into Euston.,The War of the Worlds,2828
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2829
36,For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank,The War of the Worlds,2830
36,"astonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, and",The War of the Worlds,2831
36,delivering their incomprehensible message.  Then the door behind him,The War of the Worlds,2832
36,"opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed",The War of the Worlds,2833
36,"only in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his",The War of the Worlds,2834
36,"waist, his hair disordered from his pillow.",The War of the Worlds,2835
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2836
36,"""What the devil is it?"" he asked.  ""A fire?  What a devil of a",The War of the Worlds,2837
36,"row!""",The War of the Worlds,2838
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2839
36,"They both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hear",The War of the Worlds,2840
36,what the policemen were shouting.  People were coming out of the side,The War of the Worlds,2841
36,"streets, and standing in groups at the corners talking.",The War of the Worlds,2842
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2843
36,"""What the devil is it all about?"" said my brother's fellow lodger.",The War of the Worlds,2844
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2845
36,"My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with",The War of the Worlds,2846
36,each garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing,The War of the Worlds,2847
36,excitement.  And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers,The War of the Worlds,2848
36,came bawling into the street:,The War of the Worlds,2849
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2850
36,"""London in danger of suffocation!  The Kingston and Richmond",The War of the Worlds,2851
36,"defences forced!  Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!""",The War of the Worlds,2852
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2853
36,"And all about him--in the rooms below, in the houses on each side",The War of the Worlds,2854
36,"and across the road, and behind in the Park Terraces and in the",The War of the Worlds,2855
36,"hundred other streets of that part of Marylebone, and the Westbourne",The War of the Worlds,2856
36,"Park district and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn",The War of the Worlds,2857
36,"and St. John's Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and",The War of the Worlds,2858
36,"Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the",The War of the Worlds,2859
36,vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham--people were rubbing their,The War of the Worlds,2860
36,"eyes, and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions,",The War of the Worlds,2861
36,dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew,The War of the Worlds,2862
36,"through the streets.  It was the dawn of the great panic.  London,",The War of the Worlds,2863
36,"which had gone to bed on Sunday night oblivious and inert, was",The War of the Worlds,2864
36,"awakened, in the small hours of Monday morning, to a vivid sense of",The War of the Worlds,2865
36,danger.,The War of the Worlds,2866
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2867
36,"Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went",The War of the Worlds,2868
36,"down and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of",The War of the Worlds,2869
36,the houses grew pink with the early dawn.  The flying people on foot,The War of the Worlds,2870
36,"and in vehicles grew more numerous every moment.  ""Black Smoke!"" he",The War of the Worlds,2871
36,"heard people crying, and again ""Black Smoke!""  The contagion of such",The War of the Worlds,2872
36,a unanimous fear was inevitable.  As my brother hesitated on the,The War of the Worlds,2873
36,"door-step, he saw another news vender approaching, and got a paper",The War of the Worlds,2874
36,"forthwith.  The man was running away with the rest, and selling his",The War of the Worlds,2875
36,papers for a shilling each as he ran--a grotesque mingling of profit,The War of the Worlds,2876
36,and panic.,The War of the Worlds,2877
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2878
36,And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of,The War of the Worlds,2879
36,the Commander-in-Chief:,The War of the Worlds,2880
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2881

36,"advancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way.  It",The War of the Worlds,2885

36,"carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water",The War of the Worlds,2896
36,trough up the street.  Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the,The War of the Worlds,2897
36,"houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps.",The War of the Worlds,2898
36,"And overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm.",The War of the Worlds,2899
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2900
36,"He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down",The War of the Worlds,2901

36,"As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he",The War of the Worlds,2905

36,WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREY,The War of the Worlds,2914
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2915
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2916
36,It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under,The War of the Worlds,2917
36,"the hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was",The War of the Worlds,2918
36,"watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the",The War of the Worlds,2919
36,Martians had resumed the offensive.  So far as one can ascertain from,The War of the Worlds,2920
36,"the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of",The War of the Worlds,2921
36,them remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine,The War of the Worlds,2922
36,"that night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of",The War of the Worlds,2923
36,green smoke.,The War of the Worlds,2924
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2925
36,"But three certainly came out about eight o'clock and, advancing",The War of the Worlds,2926
36,"slowly and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford",The War of the Worlds,2927
36,"towards Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant",The War of the Worlds,2928
36,batteries against the setting sun.  These Martians did not advance in,The War of the Worlds,2929
36,"a body, but in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest",The War of the Worlds,2930
36,fellow.  They communicated with one another by means of sirenlike,The War of the Worlds,2931
36,"howls, running up and down the scale from one note to another.",The War of the Worlds,2932
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2933
36,It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St.,The War of the Worlds,2934
36,George's Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford.  The Ripley,The War of the Worlds,2935
36,"gunners, unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been",The War of the Worlds,2936
36,"placed in such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual",The War of the Worlds,2937
36,"volley, and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village,",The War of the Worlds,2938
36,"while the Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over",The War of the Worlds,2939
36,"their guns, stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and",The War of the Worlds,2940
36,"so came unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he",The War of the Worlds,2941
36,destroyed.,The War of the Worlds,2942
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2943
36,"The St. George's Hill men, however, were better led or of a better",The War of the Worlds,2944
36,"mettle.  Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been",The War of the Worlds,2945
36,quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them.  They laid their,The War of the Worlds,2946
36,"guns as deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at about",The War of the Worlds,2947
36,a thousand yards' range.,The War of the Worlds,2948
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2949
36,"The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few",The War of the Worlds,2950
36,"paces, stagger, and go down.  Everybody yelled together, and the guns",The War of the Worlds,2951
36,were reloaded in frantic haste.  The overthrown Martian set up a,The War of the Worlds,2952
36,"prolonged ululation, and immediately a second glittering giant,",The War of the Worlds,2953
36,"answering him, appeared over the trees to the south.  It would seem",The War of the Worlds,2954
36,that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells.  The,The War of the Worlds,2955
36,"whole of the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground,",The War of the Worlds,2956
36,"and, simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to",The War of the Worlds,2957
36,"bear on the battery.  The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about",The War of the Worlds,2958
36,"the guns flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were",The War of the Worlds,2959
36,already running over the crest of the hill escaped.,The War of the Worlds,2960
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2961
36,After this it would seem that the three took counsel together and,The War of the Worlds,2962
36,"halted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they",The War of the Worlds,2963
36,remained absolutely stationary for the next half hour.  The Martian,The War of the Worlds,2964
36,"who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small",The War of the Worlds,2965
36,"brown figure, oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of",The War of the Worlds,2966
36,"blight, and apparently engaged in the repair of his support.  About",The War of the Worlds,2967
36,"nine he had finished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees",The War of the Worlds,2968
36,again.,The War of the Worlds,2969
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2970
36,It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three,The War of the Worlds,2971
36,"sentinels were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick",The War of the Worlds,2972
36,"black tube.  A similar tube was handed to each of the three, and the",The War of the Worlds,2973
36,seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a,The War of the Worlds,2974
36,"curved line between St. George's Hill, Weybridge, and the village of",The War of the Worlds,2975
36,"Send, southwest of Ripley.",The War of the Worlds,2976
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2977
36,A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they,The War of the Worlds,2978
36,"began to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and",The War of the Worlds,2979
36,"Esher.  At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly",The War of the Worlds,2980
36,"armed with tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against",The War of the Worlds,2981
36,"the western sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we",The War of the Worlds,2982
36,hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out,The War of the Worlds,2983
36,"of Halliford.  They moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a",The War of the Worlds,2984
36,milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height.,The War of the Worlds,2985
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2986
36,"At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began",The War of the Worlds,2987
36,"running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I",The War of the Worlds,2988
36,turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the,The War of the Worlds,2989
36,"broad ditch by the side of the road.  He looked back, saw what I was",The War of the Worlds,2990
36,"doing, and turned to join me.",The War of the Worlds,2991
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2992
36,"The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the",The War of the Worlds,2993
36,"remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away",The War of the Worlds,2994
36,towards Staines.,The War of the Worlds,2995
36,"",The War of the Worlds,2996
36,The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up,The War of the Worlds,2997
36,their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute,The War of the Worlds,2998
36,silence.  It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns.  Never,The War of the Worlds,2999
36,since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so,The War of the Worlds,3000
36,still.  To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had,The War of the Worlds,3001
36,precisely the same effect--the Martians seemed in solitary possession,The War of the Worlds,3002
36,"of the darkling night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the",The War of the Worlds,3003
36,"stars, the afterglow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St.",The War of the Worlds,3004
36,George's Hill and the woods of Painshill.,The War of the Worlds,3005
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3006
36,"But facing that crescent everywhere--at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,",The War of the Worlds,3007
36,"Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across",The War of the Worlds,3008
36,"the flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees",The War of the Worlds,3009
36,or village houses gave sufficient cover--the guns were waiting.  The,The War of the Worlds,3010
36,signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and,The War of the Worlds,3011
36,"vanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a",The War of the Worlds,3012
36,tense expectation.  The Martians had but to advance into the line of,The War of the Worlds,3013
36,"fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns",The War of the Worlds,3014
36,"glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a",The War of the Worlds,3015
36,thunderous fury of battle.,The War of the Worlds,3016
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3017
36,No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those,The War of the Worlds,3018
36,"vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle--how",The War of the Worlds,3019
36,much they understood of us.  Did they grasp that we in our millions,The War of the Worlds,3020
36,"were organized, disciplined, working together?  Or did they interpret",The War of the Worlds,3021
36,"our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady",The War of the Worlds,3022
36,"investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of",The War of the Worlds,3023
36,onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?  Did they dream they might,The War of the Worlds,3024
36,exterminate us?  (At that time no one knew what food they needed.)  A,The War of the Worlds,3025
36,hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that,The War of the Worlds,3026
36,vast sentinel shape.  And in the back of my mind was the sense of all,The War of the Worlds,3027
36,the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward.  Had they prepared,The War of the Worlds,3028
36,pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare?  Would,The War of the Worlds,3029
36,the Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of,The War of the Worlds,3030
36,their mighty province of houses?,The War of the Worlds,3031
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3032
36,"Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and",The War of the Worlds,3033
36,"peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of",The War of the Worlds,3034
36,"a gun.  Another nearer, and then another.  And then the Martian beside",The War of the Worlds,3035
36,"us raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy",The War of the Worlds,3036
36,report that made the ground heave.  The one towards Staines answered,The War of the Worlds,3037
36,"him.  There was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation.",The War of the Worlds,3038
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3039
36,I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another,The War of the Worlds,3040
36,that I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to,The War of the Worlds,3041
36,clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury.  As I did so a,The War of the Worlds,3042
36,"second report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards",The War of the Worlds,3043
36,"Hounslow.  I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such",The War of the Worlds,3044
36,"evidence of its work.  But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with",The War of the Worlds,3045
36,"one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath.",The War of the Worlds,3046
36,"And there had been no crash, no answering explosion.  The silence was",The War of the Worlds,3047
36,restored; the minute lengthened to three.,The War of the Worlds,3048
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3049
36,"""What has happened?"" said the curate, standing up beside me.",The War of the Worlds,3050
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3051
36,"""Heaven knows!"" said I.",The War of the Worlds,3052
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3053
36,A bat flickered by and vanished.  A distant tumult of shouting,The War of the Worlds,3054
36,"began and ceased.  I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now",The War of the Worlds,3055
36,"moving eastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion.",The War of the Worlds,3056
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3057
36,Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring,The War of the Worlds,3058
36,upon him; but the evening calm was unbroken.  The figure of the Martian,The War of the Worlds,3059
36,"grew smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering",The War of the Worlds,3060
36,night had swallowed him up.  By a common impulse we clambered higher.,The War of the Worlds,3061
36,"Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had",The War of the Worlds,3062
36,"suddenly come into being there, hiding our view of the farther",The War of the Worlds,3063
36,"country; and then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw",The War of the Worlds,3064
36,another such summit.  These hill-like forms grew lower and broader,The War of the Worlds,3065
36,even as we stared.,The War of the Worlds,3066
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3067
36,"Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I",The War of the Worlds,3068
36,perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.,The War of the Worlds,3069
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3070
36,Everything had suddenly become very still.  Far away to the,The War of the Worlds,3071
36,"southeast, marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one",The War of the Worlds,3072
36,"another, and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of",The War of the Worlds,3073
36,their guns.  But the earthly artillery made no reply.,The War of the Worlds,3074
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3075
36,"Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I",The War of the Worlds,3076
36,was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the,The War of the Worlds,3077
36,"twilight.  Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have",The War of the Worlds,3078
36,"described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a",The War of the Worlds,3079
36,"huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other",The War of the Worlds,3080
36,"possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him.  Some fired",The War of the Worlds,3081
36,"only one of these, some two--as in the case of the one we had seen;",The War of the Worlds,3082
36,the one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at,The War of the Worlds,3083
36,that time.  These canisters smashed on striking the ground--they did,The War of the Worlds,3084
36,"not explode--and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy,",The War of the Worlds,3085
36,"inky vapour, coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus",The War of the Worlds,3086
36,"cloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the",The War of the Worlds,3087
36,"surrounding country.  And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of",The War of the Worlds,3088
36,"its pungent wisps, was death to all that breathes.",The War of the Worlds,3089
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3090
36,"It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,",The War of the Worlds,3091
36,"after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank",The War of the Worlds,3092
36,down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather,The War of the Worlds,3093
36,"liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the",The War of the Worlds,3094
36,valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the,The War of the Worlds,3095
36,carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do.  And,The War of the Worlds,3096
36,"where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the",The War of the Worlds,3097
36,surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank,The War of the Worlds,3098
36,"slowly and made way for more.  The scum was absolutely insoluble, and",The War of the Worlds,3099
36,"it is a strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one",The War of the Worlds,3100
36,could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained.,The War of the Worlds,3101
36,The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do.  It hung together,The War of the Worlds,3102
36,"in banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving",The War of the Worlds,3103
36,"reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist",The War of the Worlds,3104
36,"and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust.",The War of the Worlds,3105
36,Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue,The War of the Worlds,3106
36,"of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the",The War of the Worlds,3107
36,nature of this substance.,The War of the Worlds,3108
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3109
36,"Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black",The War of the Worlds,3110
36,"smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,",The War of the Worlds,3111
36,"that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high",The War of the Worlds,3112
36,"houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison",The War of the Worlds,3113
36,"altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton.",The War of the Worlds,3114
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3115
36,The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of,The War of the Worlds,3116
36,"the strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the",The War of the Worlds,3117
36,church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out,The War of the Worlds,3118
36,"of its inky nothingness.  For a day and a half he remained there,",The War of the Worlds,3119
36,"weary, starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and",The War of the Worlds,3120
36,"against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with",The War of the Worlds,3121
36,"red roofs, green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates,",The War of the Worlds,3122
36,"barns, outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.",The War of the Worlds,3123
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3124
36,"But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed",The War of the Worlds,3125
36,to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground.  As a rule,The War of the Worlds,3126
36,"the Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it",The War of the Worlds,3127
36,again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it.,The War of the Worlds,3128
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3129
36,"This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the",The War of the Worlds,3130
36,"starlight from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford,",The War of the Worlds,3131
36,whither we had returned.  From there we could see the searchlights on,The War of the Worlds,3132
36,"Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the",The War of the Worlds,3133
36,"windows rattled, and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that",The War of the Worlds,3134
36,had been put in position there.  These continued intermittently for,The War of the Worlds,3135
36,"the space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the",The War of the Worlds,3136
36,"invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of",The War of the Worlds,3137
36,"the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.",The War of the Worlds,3138
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3139
36,Then the fourth cylinder fell--a brilliant green meteor--as I,The War of the Worlds,3140
36,"learned afterwards, in Bushey Park.  Before the guns on the Richmond",The War of the Worlds,3141
36,"and Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far",The War of the Worlds,3142
36,"away in the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard",The War of the Worlds,3143
36,before the black vapour could overwhelm the gunners.,The War of the Worlds,3144
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3145
36,"So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a",The War of the Worlds,3146
36,"wasps' nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the",The War of the Worlds,3147
36,"Londonward country.  The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart,",The War of the Worlds,3148
36,until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden.,The War of the Worlds,3149
36,"All night through their destructive tubes advanced.  Never once, after",The War of the Worlds,3150
36,"the Martian at St. George's Hill was brought down, did they give the",The War of the Worlds,3151
36,artillery the ghost of a chance against them.  Wherever there was a,The War of the Worlds,3152
36,"possibility of guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of",The War of the Worlds,3153
36,"the black vapour was discharged, and where the guns were openly",The War of the Worlds,3154
36,displayed the Heat-Ray was brought to bear.,The War of the Worlds,3155
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3156
36,By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and,The War of the Worlds,3157
36,the glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black,The War of the Worlds,3158
36,"smoke, blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as",The War of the Worlds,3159
36,far as the eye could reach.  And through this two Martians slowly,The War of the Worlds,3160
36,"waded, and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that.",The War of the Worlds,3161
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3162
36,"They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they",The War of the Worlds,3163
36,had but a limited supply of material for its production or because,The War of the Worlds,3164
36,they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe,The War of the Worlds,3165
36,the opposition they had aroused.  In the latter aim they certainly,The War of the Worlds,3166
36,succeeded.  Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to,The War of the Worlds,3167
36,"their movements.  After that no body of men would stand against them,",The War of the Worlds,3168
36,so hopeless was the enterprise.  Even the crews of the torpedo-boats,The War of the Worlds,3169
36,and destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames,The War of the Worlds,3170
36,"refused to stop, mutinied, and went down again.  The only offensive",The War of the Worlds,3171
36,operation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation of,The War of the Worlds,3172
36,"mines and pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic and",The War of the Worlds,3173
36,spasmodic.,The War of the Worlds,3174
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3175
36,"One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries",The War of the Worlds,3176
36,"towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight.  Survivors there",The War of the Worlds,3177
36,"were none.  One may picture the orderly expectation, the officers",The War of the Worlds,3178
36,"alert and watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand,",The War of the Worlds,3179
36,"the limber gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of",The War of the Worlds,3180
36,"civilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted, the",The War of the Worlds,3181
36,"evening stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned",The War of the Worlds,3182
36,and wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the,The War of the Worlds,3183
36,"Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and",The War of the Worlds,3184
36,houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields.,The War of the Worlds,3185
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3186
36,"One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the",The War of the Worlds,3187
36,swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing,The War of the Worlds,3188
36,"headlong, towering heavenward, turning the twilight to a palpable",The War of the Worlds,3189
36,"darkness, a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon",The War of the Worlds,3190
36,"its victims, men and horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking,",The War of the Worlds,3191
36,"falling headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, men",The War of the Worlds,3192
36,"choking and writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out of",The War of the Worlds,3193
36,the opaque cone of smoke.  And then night and extinction--nothing but,The War of the Worlds,3194

36,"",The War of the Worlds,3207
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3208
36,So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the,The War of the Worlds,3209
36,greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning--the stream of,The War of the Worlds,3210
36,"flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round",The War of the Worlds,3211
36,"the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the",The War of the Worlds,3212
36,"shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel",The War of the Worlds,3213
36,"northward and eastward.  By ten o'clock the police organisation, and",The War of the Worlds,3214
36,"by midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency,",The War of the Worlds,3215
36,"losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in",The War of the Worlds,3216
36,that swift liquefaction of the social body.,The War of the Worlds,3217
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3218
36,All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern,The War of the Worlds,3219
36,"people at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and",The War of the Worlds,3220
36,trains were being filled.  People were fighting savagely for,The War of the Worlds,3221
36,"standing-room in the carriages even at two o'clock.  By three, people",The War of the Worlds,3222
36,"were being trampled and crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple",The War of the Worlds,3223
36,of hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were,The War of the Worlds,3224
36,"fired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent to direct",The War of the Worlds,3225
36,"the traffic, exhausted and infuriated, were breaking the heads of the",The War of the Worlds,3226
36,people they were called out to protect.,The War of the Worlds,3227
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3228
36,And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused,The War of the Worlds,3229
36,"to return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an",The War of the Worlds,3230
36,ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the,The War of the Worlds,3231
36,"northward-running roads.  By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,",The War of the Worlds,3232
36,and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and,The War of the Worlds,3233
36,"across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges",The War of the Worlds,3234
36,"in its sluggish advance.  Another bank drove over Ealing, and",The War of the Worlds,3235
36,"surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but",The War of the Worlds,3236
36,unable to escape.,The War of the Worlds,3237
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3238
36,After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at,The War of the Worlds,3239
36,Chalk Farm--the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods,The War of the Worlds,3240
36,"yard there _ploughed_ through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men",The War of the Worlds,3241
36,fought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his,The War of the Worlds,3242
36,"furnace--my brother emerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across",The War of the Worlds,3243
36,"through a hurrying swarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost",The War of the Worlds,3244
36,in the sack of a cycle shop.  The front tire of the machine he got was,The War of the Worlds,3245
36,"punctured in dragging it through the window, but he got up and off,",The War of the Worlds,3246
36,"notwithstanding, with no further injury than a cut wrist.  The steep",The War of the Worlds,3247
36,foot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several overturned,The War of the Worlds,3248
36,"horses, and my brother struck into Belsize Road.",The War of the Worlds,3249
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3250
36,"So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware",The War of the Worlds,3251
36,"Road, reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead",The War of the Worlds,3252
36,"of the crowd.  Along the road people were standing in the roadway,",The War of the Worlds,3253
36,"curious, wondering.  He was passed by a number of cyclists, some",The War of the Worlds,3254
36,"horsemen, and two motor cars.  A mile from Edgware the rim of the",The War of the Worlds,3255
36,"wheel broke, and the machine became unridable.  He left it by the",The War of the Worlds,3256
36,roadside and trudged through the village.  There were shops half,The War of the Worlds,3257
36,"opened in the main street of the place, and people crowded on the",The War of the Worlds,3258
36,"pavement and in the doorways and windows, staring astonished at this",The War of the Worlds,3259
36,extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning.  He,The War of the Worlds,3260
36,succeeded in getting some food at an inn.,The War of the Worlds,3261
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3262
36,For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do.  The,The War of the Worlds,3263
36,"flying people increased in number.  Many of them, like my brother,",The War of the Worlds,3264
36,seemed inclined to loiter in the place.  There was no fresh news of,The War of the Worlds,3265
36,the invaders from Mars.,The War of the Worlds,3266
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3267
36,"At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested.",The War of the Worlds,3268
36,"Most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there",The War of the Worlds,3269
36,"were soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and",The War of the Worlds,3270
36,the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans.,The War of the Worlds,3271
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3272
36,"It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where",The War of the Worlds,3273
36,"some friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike",The War of the Worlds,3274
36,"into a quiet lane running eastward.  Presently he came upon a stile,",The War of the Worlds,3275
36,"and, crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward.  He passed near",The War of the Worlds,3276
36,several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not,The War of the Worlds,3277
36,"learn.  He saw few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High",The War of the Worlds,3278
36,"Barnet, he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers.",The War of the Worlds,3279
36,He came upon them just in time to save them.,The War of the Worlds,3280
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3281
36,"He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a",The War of the Worlds,3282
36,couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in,The War of the Worlds,3283
36,"which they had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the",The War of the Worlds,3284
36,"frightened pony's head.  One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in",The War of the Worlds,3285
36,"white, was simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure,",The War of the Worlds,3286
36,slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her,The War of the Worlds,3287
36,disengaged hand.,The War of the Worlds,3288
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3289
36,"My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried",The War of the Worlds,3290
36,"towards the struggle.  One of the men desisted and turned towards him,",The War of the Worlds,3291
36,"and my brother, realising from his antagonist's face that a fight was",The War of the Worlds,3292
36,"unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and",The War of the Worlds,3293
36,sent him down against the wheel of the chaise.,The War of the Worlds,3294
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3295
36,It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him,The War of the Worlds,3296
36,"quiet with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the",The War of the Worlds,3297
36,"slender lady's arm.  He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung",The War of the Worlds,3298
36,"across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and",The War of the Worlds,3299
36,the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in,The War of the Worlds,3300
36,the direction from which he had come.,The War of the Worlds,3301
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3302
36,"Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the",The War of the Worlds,3303
36,"horse's head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down",The War of the Worlds,3304
36,"the lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking",The War of the Worlds,3305
36,"back.  The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he",The War of the Worlds,3306
36,"stopped him with a blow in the face.  Then, realising that he was",The War of the Worlds,3307
36,"deserted, he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise,",The War of the Worlds,3308
36,"with the sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned",The War of the Worlds,3309
36,"now, following remotely.",The War of the Worlds,3310
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3311
36,"Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong,",The War of the Worlds,3312
36,and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists,The War of the Worlds,3313
36,again.  He would have had little chance against them had not the,The War of the Worlds,3314
36,slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help.  It,The War of the Worlds,3315
36,"seems she had had a revolver all this time, but it had been under the",The War of the Worlds,3316
36,seat when she and her companion were attacked.  She fired at six,The War of the Worlds,3317
36,"yards' distance, narrowly missing my brother.  The less courageous of",The War of the Worlds,3318
36,"the robbers made off, and his companion followed him, cursing his",The War of the Worlds,3319
36,"cowardice.  They both stopped in sight down the lane, where the third",The War of the Worlds,3320
36,man lay insensible.,The War of the Worlds,3321
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3322
36,"""Take this!"" said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her",The War of the Worlds,3323
36,revolver.,The War of the Worlds,3324
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3325
36,"""Go back to the chaise,"" said my brother, wiping the blood from his",The War of the Worlds,3326
36,split lip.,The War of the Worlds,3327
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3328
36,She turned without a word--they were both panting--and they went,The War of the Worlds,3329
36,back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened,The War of the Worlds,3330
36,pony.,The War of the Worlds,3331
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3332
36,The robbers had evidently had enough of it.  When my brother looked,The War of the Worlds,3333
36,again they were retreating.,The War of the Worlds,3334
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3335
36,"""I'll sit here,"" said my brother, ""if I may""; and he got upon the",The War of the Worlds,3336
36,empty front seat.  The lady looked over her shoulder.,The War of the Worlds,3337
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3338
36,"""Give me the reins,"" she said, and laid the whip along the pony's",The War of the Worlds,3339
36,side.  In another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my,The War of the Worlds,3340
36,brother's eyes.,The War of the Worlds,3341
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3342
36,"So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a",The War of the Worlds,3343
36,"cut mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an",The War of the Worlds,3344
36,unknown lane with these two women.,The War of the Worlds,3345
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3346
36,He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon,The War of the Worlds,3347
36,"living at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous",The War of the Worlds,3348
36,"case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the",The War of the Worlds,3349
36,"Martian advance.  He had hurried home, roused the women--their servant",The War of the Worlds,3350
36,"had left them two days before--packed some provisions, put his",The War of the Worlds,3351
36,revolver under the seat--luckily for my brother--and told them to,The War of the Worlds,3352
36,"drive on to Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there.  He",The War of the Worlds,3353
36,"stopped behind to tell the neighbours.  He would overtake them, he",The War of the Worlds,3354
36,"said, at about half past four in the morning, and now it was nearly",The War of the Worlds,3355
36,nine and they had seen nothing of him.  They could not stop in Edgware,The War of the Worlds,3356
36,"because of the growing traffic through the place, and so they had come",The War of the Worlds,3357
36,into this side lane.,The War of the Worlds,3358
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3359
36,That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently,The War of the Worlds,3360
36,"they stopped again, nearer to New Barnet.  He promised to stay with",The War of the Worlds,3361
36,"them, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the",The War of the Worlds,3362
36,"missing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with the",The War of the Worlds,3363
36,revolver--a weapon strange to him--in order to give them confidence.,The War of the Worlds,3364
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3365
36,"They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became",The War of the Worlds,3366
36,"happy in the hedge.  He told them of his own escape out of London, and",The War of the Worlds,3367
36,all that he knew of these Martians and their ways.  The sun crept,The War of the Worlds,3368
36,"higher in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place",The War of the Worlds,3369
36,to an uneasy state of anticipation.  Several wayfarers came along the,The War of the Worlds,3370
36,"lane, and of these my brother gathered such news as he could.  Every",The War of the Worlds,3371
36,broken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster,The War of the Worlds,3372
36,"that had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate",The War of the Worlds,3373
36,necessity for prosecuting this flight.  He urged the matter upon them.,The War of the Worlds,3374

36,"""We have money,"" said the slender woman, and hesitated.",The War of the Worlds,3376

36,"Her eyes met my brother's, and her hesitation ended.",The War of the Worlds,3378
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3379
36,"""So have I,"" said my brother.",The War of the Worlds,3380
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3381
36,"She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold,",The War of the Worlds,3382
36,"besides a five-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get",The War of the Worlds,3383
36,upon a train at St. Albans or New Barnet.  My brother thought that was,The War of the Worlds,3384
36,"hopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,",The War of the Worlds,3385
36,and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and,The War of the Worlds,3386
36,thence escaping from the country altogether.,The War of the Worlds,3387
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3388
36,Mrs. Elphinstone--that was the name of the woman in white--would,The War of the Worlds,3389
36,"listen to no reasoning, and kept calling upon ""George""; but her",The War of the Worlds,3390
36,"sister-in-law was astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last",The War of the Worlds,3391
36,"agreed to my brother's suggestion.  So, designing to cross the Great",The War of the Worlds,3392
36,"North Road, they went on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony",The War of the Worlds,3393
36,to save it as much as possible.  As the sun crept up the sky the day,The War of the Worlds,3394
36,"became excessively hot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew",The War of the Worlds,3395
36,"burning and blinding, so that they travelled only very slowly.  The",The War of the Worlds,3396
36,hedges were grey with dust.  And as they advanced towards Barnet a,The War of the Worlds,3397
36,tumultuous murmuring grew stronger.,The War of the Worlds,3398
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3399
36,They began to meet more people.  For the most part these were,The War of the Worlds,3400
36,"staring before them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard,",The War of the Worlds,3401
36,"unclean.  One man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on",The War of the Worlds,3402
36,"the ground.  They heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw one",The War of the Worlds,3403
36,hand clutched in his hair and the other beating invisible things.  His,The War of the Worlds,3404
36,"paroxysm of rage over, he went on his way without once looking back.",The War of the Worlds,3405
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3406
36,As my brother's party went on towards the crossroads to the south,The War of the Worlds,3407
36,of Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on,The War of the Worlds,3408
36,"their left, carrying a child and with two other children; and then",The War of the Worlds,3409
36,"passed a man in dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and a",The War of the Worlds,3410
36,"small portmanteau in the other.  Then round the corner of the lane,",The War of the Worlds,3411
36,from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the,The War of the Worlds,3412
36,"high road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and",The War of the Worlds,3413
36,"driven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust.  There were",The War of the Worlds,3414
36,"three girls, East End factory girls, and a couple of little children",The War of the Worlds,3415
36,crowded in the cart.,The War of the Worlds,3416
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3417
36,"""This'll tike us rahnd Edgware?"" asked the driver, wild-eyed,",The War of the Worlds,3418
36,white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the,The War of the Worlds,3419
36,"left, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks.",The War of the Worlds,3420
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3421
36,My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the,The War of the Worlds,3422
36,"houses in front of them, and veiling the white facade of a terrace",The War of the Worlds,3423
36,beyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas.  Mrs.,The War of the Worlds,3424
36,Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red,The War of the Worlds,3425
36,"flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot,",The War of the Worlds,3426
36,blue sky.  The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the,The War of the Worlds,3427
36,"disorderly mingling of many voices, the gride of many wheels, the",The War of the Worlds,3428
36,"creaking of waggons, and the staccato of hoofs.  The lane came round",The War of the Worlds,3429
36,sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads.,The War of the Worlds,3430
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3431
36,"""Good heavens!"" cried Mrs. Elphinstone.  ""What is this you are",The War of the Worlds,3432
36,"driving us into?""",The War of the Worlds,3433

36,My brother stopped.,The War of the Worlds,3435
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3436
36,"For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent of",The War of the Worlds,3437
36,"human beings rushing northward, one pressing on another.  A great bank",The War of the Worlds,3438
36,"of dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything",The War of the Worlds,3439
36,within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was,The War of the Worlds,3440
36,perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses,The War of the Worlds,3441
36,"and of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every",The War of the Worlds,3442
36,description.,The War of the Worlds,3443
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3444
36,"""Way!"" my brother heard voices crying.  ""Make way!""",The War of the Worlds,3445
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3446
36,It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting,The War of the Worlds,3447
36,"point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust",The War of the Worlds,3448
36,"was hot and pungent.  And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa",The War of the Worlds,3449
36,was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road,The War of the Worlds,3450
36,to add to the confusion.,The War of the Worlds,3451
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3452
36,"Two men came past them.  Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy",The War of the Worlds,3453
36,"bundle and weeping.  A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue,",The War of the Worlds,3454
36,"circled dubiously round them, scared and wretched, and fled at my",The War of the Worlds,3455
36,brother's threat.,The War of the Worlds,3456
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3457
36,So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses,The War of the Worlds,3458
36,"to the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent",The War of the Worlds,3459
36,"in between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded",The War of the Worlds,3460
36,"forms, grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner,",The War of the Worlds,3461
36,"hurried past, and merged their individuality again in a receding",The War of the Worlds,3462
36,multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust.,The War of the Worlds,3463
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3464
36,"""Go on!  Go on!"" cried the voices.  ""Way!  Way!""",The War of the Worlds,3465
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3466
36,One man's hands pressed on the back of another.  My brother stood,The War of the Worlds,3467
36,"at the pony's head.  Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace",The War of the Worlds,3468
36,"by pace, down the lane.",The War of the Worlds,3469
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3470
36,"Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult,",The War of the Worlds,3471
36,but this was a whole population in movement.  It is hard to imagine,The War of the Worlds,3472
36,that host.  It had no character of its own.  The figures poured out,The War of the Worlds,3473
36,"past the corner, and receded with their backs to the group in the",The War of the Worlds,3474
36,lane.  Along the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the,The War of the Worlds,3475
36,"wheels, stumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another.",The War of the Worlds,3476
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3477
36,"The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making",The War of the Worlds,3478
36,little way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted,The War of the Worlds,3479
36,forward every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing,The War of the Worlds,3480
36,"so, sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the",The War of the Worlds,3481

36,"",The War of the Worlds,3485
36,"In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,",The War of the Worlds,3486
36,"gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, ""Eternity!",The War of the Worlds,3487
36,"Eternity!""  His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother",The War of the Worlds,3488
36,could hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust.  Some of,The War of the Worlds,3489
36,the people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses,The War of the Worlds,3490
36,"and quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at",The War of the Worlds,3491
36,"nothing with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or",The War of the Worlds,3492
36,lay prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances.  The horses' bits,The War of the Worlds,3493
36,"were covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.",The War of the Worlds,3494
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3495

36,huge timber waggon crowded with roughs.  A brewer's dray rumbled by,The War of the Worlds,3498

36,"",The War of the Worlds,3500

36,"",The War of the Worlds,3502
36,"""Eter-nity!  Eter-nity!"" came echoing down the road.",The War of the Worlds,3503
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3504
36,"There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with",The War of the Worlds,3505
36,"children that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in",The War of the Worlds,3506
36,"dust, their weary faces smeared with tears.  With many of these came",The War of the Worlds,3507
36,"men, sometimes helpful, sometimes lowering and savage.  Fighting side",The War of the Worlds,3508
36,by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black,The War of the Worlds,3509
36,"rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed.  There were sturdy",The War of the Worlds,3510
36,"workmen thrusting their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like",The War of the Worlds,3511
36,"clerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my",The War of the Worlds,3512
36,"brother noticed, men dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one",The War of the Worlds,3513
36,wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it.,The War of the Worlds,3514
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3515
36,"But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had",The War of the Worlds,3516
36,"in common.  There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind",The War of the Worlds,3517
36,"them.  A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent",The War of the Worlds,3518
36,the whole host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and,The War of the Worlds,3519
36,broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into,The War of the Worlds,3520
36,renewed activity.  The heat and dust had already been at work upon,The War of the Worlds,3521
36,"this multitude.  Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked.",The War of the Worlds,3522
36,"They were all thirsty, weary, and footsore.  And amid the various",The War of the Worlds,3523
36,"cries one heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue;",The War of the Worlds,3524
36,the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak.  Through it all ran a,The War of the Worlds,3525
36,refrain:,The War of the Worlds,3526
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3527
36,"""Way!  Way!  The Martians are coming!""",The War of the Worlds,3528
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3529
36,Few stopped and came aside from that flood.  The lane opened,The War of the Worlds,3530
36,"slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a",The War of the Worlds,3531
36,delusive appearance of coming from the direction of London.  Yet a,The War of the Worlds,3532
36,kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of,The War of the Worlds,3533
36,"the stream, who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging",The War of the Worlds,3534
36,"into it again.  A little way down the lane, with two friends bending",The War of the Worlds,3535
36,"over him, lay a man with a bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags.",The War of the Worlds,3536
36,He was a lucky man to have friends.,The War of the Worlds,3537
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3538
36,"A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black",The War of the Worlds,3539
36,"frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his",The War of the Worlds,3540
36,"boot--his sock was blood-stained--shook out a pebble, and hobbled on",The War of the Worlds,3541
36,"again; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw",The War of the Worlds,3542
36,"herself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping.",The War of the Worlds,3543
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3544

36,"My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up,",The War of the Worlds,3547
36,"speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone.  So soon",The War of the Worlds,3548
36,"as my brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened.",The War of the Worlds,3549
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3550
36,"""Ellen!"" shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her",The War of the Worlds,3551

36,lane.,The War of the Worlds,3556
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3557
36,"""Out of the way, there!"" bawled a coachman, towering high; and my",The War of the Worlds,3558
36,brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane.,The War of the Worlds,3559
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3560
36,The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse.  My,The War of the Worlds,3561
36,"brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man",The War of the Worlds,3562
36,"drove by and stopped at the turn of the way.  It was a carriage, with",The War of the Worlds,3563
36,"a pole for a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces.  My",The War of the Worlds,3564
36,brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something,The War of the Worlds,3565
36,on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet,The War of the Worlds,3566

36,"on!""",The War of the Worlds,3585
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3586
36,"Then my brother's attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced",The War of the Worlds,3587
36,"man lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother's",The War of the Worlds,3588
36,eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to,The War of the Worlds,3589
36,break up into separate coins as it struck the ground.  They rolled,The War of the Worlds,3590
36,hither and thither among the struggling feet of men and horses.  The,The War of the Worlds,3591
36,"man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab",The War of the Worlds,3592
36,struck his shoulder and sent him reeling.  He gave a shriek and dodged,The War of the Worlds,3593
36,"back, and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly.",The War of the Worlds,3594
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3595
36,"""Way!"" cried the men all about him.  ""Make way!""",The War of the Worlds,3596
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3597
36,"So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands",The War of the Worlds,3598
36,"open, upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his",The War of the Worlds,3599
36,"pocket.  A horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half",The War of the Worlds,3600
36,"rising, he had been borne down under the horse's hoofs.",The War of the Worlds,3601
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3602
36,"""Stop!"" screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way,",The War of the Worlds,3603
36,tried to clutch the bit of the horse.,The War of the Worlds,3604
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3605
36,"Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and",The War of the Worlds,3606
36,saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back.  The,The War of the Worlds,3607
36,"driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round",The War of the Worlds,3608
36,behind the cart.  The multitudinous shouting confused his ears.  The,The War of the Worlds,3609
36,"man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to",The War of the Worlds,3610
36,"rise, for the wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp",The War of the Worlds,3611
36,"and dead.  My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a",The War of the Worlds,3612
36,man on a black horse came to his assistance.,The War of the Worlds,3613
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3614
36,"""Get him out of the road,"" said he; and, clutching the man's collar",The War of the Worlds,3615
36,"with his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways.  But he still",The War of the Worlds,3616
36,"clutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering",The War of the Worlds,3617
36,"at his arm with a handful of gold.  ""Go on!  Go on!"" shouted angry",The War of the Worlds,3618
36,voices behind.,The War of the Worlds,3619

36,"""Way!  Way!""",The War of the Worlds,3621
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3622
36,There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart,The War of the Worlds,3623
36,"that the man on horseback stopped.  My brother looked up, and the man",The War of the Worlds,3624
36,with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his,The War of the Worlds,3625
36,"collar.  There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering",The War of the Worlds,3626
36,"sideways, and the carthorse pushed beside it.  A hoof missed my",The War of the Worlds,3627
36,brother's foot by a hair's breadth.  He released his grip on the,The War of the Worlds,3628
36,fallen man and jumped back.  He saw anger change to terror on the face,The War of the Worlds,3629
36,"of the poor wretch on the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my",The War of the Worlds,3630
36,"brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane,",The War of the Worlds,3631
36,and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it.,The War of the Worlds,3632
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3633
36,"He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with",The War of the Worlds,3634
36,"all a child's want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated",The War of the Worlds,3635
36,"eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed",The War of the Worlds,3636
36,"under the rolling wheels.  ""Let us go back!"" he shouted, and began",The War of the Worlds,3637
36,"turning the pony round. ""We cannot cross this--hell,"" he said and they",The War of the Worlds,3638
36,"went back a hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting",The War of the Worlds,3639
36,crowd was hidden.  As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw,The War of the Worlds,3640
36,"the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white",The War of the Worlds,3641
36,"and drawn, and shining with perspiration.  The two women sat silent,",The War of the Worlds,3642
36,crouching in their seat and shivering.,The War of the Worlds,3643
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3644
36,Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again.  Miss Elphinstone,The War of the Worlds,3645
36,"was white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched",The War of the Worlds,3646
36,"even to call upon ""George.""  My brother was horrified and perplexed.",The War of the Worlds,3647
36,So soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable,The War of the Worlds,3648
36,"it was to attempt this crossing.  He turned to Miss Elphinstone,",The War of the Worlds,3649
36,suddenly resolute.,The War of the Worlds,3650
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3651
36,"""We must go that way,"" he said, and led the pony round again.",The War of the Worlds,3652
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3653
36,For the second time that day this girl proved her quality.  To force,The War of the Worlds,3654
36,"their way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the",The War of the Worlds,3655
36,"traffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its",The War of the Worlds,3656
36,head.  A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter,The War of the Worlds,3657
36,from the chaise.  In another moment they were caught and swept forward,The War of the Worlds,3658
36,"by the stream.  My brother, with the cabman's whip marks red across",The War of the Worlds,3659
36,"his face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from",The War of the Worlds,3660
36,her.,The War of the Worlds,3661
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3662
36,"""Point the revolver at the man behind,"" he said, giving it to her,",The War of the Worlds,3663
36,"""if he presses us too hard.  No!--point it at his horse.""",The War of the Worlds,3664
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3665
36,Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right,The War of the Worlds,3666
36,"across the road.  But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition,",The War of the Worlds,3667
36,to become a part of that dusty rout.  They swept through Chipping,The War of the Worlds,3668
36,Barnet with the torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of,The War of the Worlds,3669
36,the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the,The War of the Worlds,3670
36,way.  It was din and confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the,The War of the Worlds,3671
36,"town the road forks repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the",The War of the Worlds,3672
36,stress.,The War of the Worlds,3673
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3674
36,"They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of",The War of the Worlds,3675
36,"the road, and at another place farther on they came upon a great",The War of the Worlds,3676
36,"multitude of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at",The War of the Worlds,3677
36,"the water.  And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw",The War of the Worlds,3678
36,two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or,The War of the Worlds,3679
36,"order--trains swarming with people, with men even among the coals",The War of the Worlds,3680
36,behind the engines--going northward along the Great Northern Railway.,The War of the Worlds,3681
36,"My brother supposes they must have filled outside London, for at that",The War of the Worlds,3682
36,time the furious terror of the people had rendered the central,The War of the Worlds,3683
36,termini impossible.,The War of the Worlds,3684
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3685
36,"Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the",The War of the Worlds,3686
36,violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them.,The War of the Worlds,3687
36,"They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and",The War of the Worlds,3688
36,none of them dared to sleep.  And in the evening many people came,The War of the Worlds,3689
36,"hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing from",The War of the Worlds,3690
36,"unknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my",The War of the Worlds,3691
36,brother had come.,The War of the Worlds,3692

36,"have annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself",The War of the Worlds,3702
36,slowly through the home counties.  Not only along the road through,The War of the Worlds,3703
36,"Barnet, but also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the",The War of the Worlds,3704
36,"roads eastward to Southend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames",The War of the Worlds,3705
36,"to Deal and Broadstairs, poured the same frantic rout.  If one could",The War of the Worlds,3706
36,have hung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above,The War of the Worlds,3707
36,London every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled,The War of the Worlds,3708
36,maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming,The War of the Worlds,3709
36,"fugitives, each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress.  I",The War of the Worlds,3710
36,have set forth at length in the last chapter my brother's account of,The War of the Worlds,3711
36,"the road through Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise",The War of the Worlds,3712
36,how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concerned.,The War of the Worlds,3713
36,Never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human,The War of the Worlds,3714
36,beings moved and suffered together.  The legendary hosts of Goths and,The War of the Worlds,3715
36,"Huns, the hugest armies Asia has ever seen, would have been but a drop",The War of the Worlds,3716
36,in that current.  And this was no disciplined march; it was a,The War of the Worlds,3717
36,stampede--a stampede gigantic and terrible--without order and without,The War of the Worlds,3718
36,"a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving",The War of the Worlds,3719
36,"headlong.  It was the beginning of the rout of civilisation, of the",The War of the Worlds,3720
36,massacre of mankind.,The War of the Worlds,3721
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3722
36,Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of,The War of the Worlds,3723
36,"streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,",The War of the Worlds,3724
36,"gardens--already derelict--spread out like a huge map, and in the",The War of the Worlds,3725
36,"southward _blotted_.  Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would",The War of the Worlds,3726
36,have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart.,The War of the Worlds,3727
36,"Steadily, incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out",The War of the Worlds,3728
36,"ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising",The War of the Worlds,3729
36,"ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley,",The War of the Worlds,3730
36,exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper.,The War of the Worlds,3731
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3732
36,"And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river,",The War of the Worlds,3733
36,"the glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically",The War of the Worlds,3734
36,spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over,The War of the Worlds,3735
36,"that, laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its",The War of the Worlds,3736
36,"purpose, and taking possession of the conquered country.  They do not",The War of the Worlds,3737
36,seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at complete,The War of the Worlds,3738
36,demoralisation and the destruction of any opposition.  They exploded,The War of the Worlds,3739
36,"any stores of powder they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked",The War of the Worlds,3740
36,the railways here and there.  They were hamstringing mankind.  They,The War of the Worlds,3741
36,"seemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations, and did",The War of the Worlds,3742
36,not come beyond the central part of London all that day.  It is,The War of the Worlds,3743
36,possible that a very considerable number of people in London stuck to,The War of the Worlds,3744
36,their houses through Monday morning.  Certain it is that many died at,The War of the Worlds,3745
36,home suffocated by the Black Smoke.,The War of the Worlds,3746
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3747
36,Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene.,The War of the Worlds,3748
36,"Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the",The War of the Worlds,3749
36,"enormous sums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many",The War of the Worlds,3750
36,who swam out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and,The War of the Worlds,3751
36,drowned.  About one o'clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a,The War of the Worlds,3752
36,cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars,The War of the Worlds,3753
36,"Bridge.  At that the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting,",The War of the Worlds,3754
36,"and collision, and for some time a multitude of boats and barges",The War of the Worlds,3755
36,"jammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and",The War of the Worlds,3756
36,lightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed upon,The War of the Worlds,3757
36,them from the riverfront.  People were actually clambering down the,The War of the Worlds,3758
36,piers of the bridge from above.,The War of the Worlds,3759
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3760
36,"When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and",The War of the Worlds,3761
36,"waded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse.",The War of the Worlds,3762
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3763
36,Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell.  The,The War of the Worlds,3764
36,"sixth star fell at Wimbledon.  My brother, keeping watch beside the",The War of the Worlds,3765
36,"women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond",The War of the Worlds,3766
36,"the hills.  On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across",The War of the Worlds,3767
36,"the sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester.",The War of the Worlds,3768
36,The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of,The War of the Worlds,3769
36,"London was confirmed.  They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it",The War of the Worlds,3770
36,"was said, at Neasden.  But they did not come into my brother's view",The War of the Worlds,3771
36,until the morrow.,The War of the Worlds,3772
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3773
36,That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need,The War of the Worlds,3774
36,of provisions.  As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to,The War of the Worlds,3775
36,"be regarded.  Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds,",The War of the Worlds,3776
36,"granaries, and ripening root crops with arms in their hands.  A number",The War of the Worlds,3777
36,"of people now, like my brother, had their faces eastward, and there",The War of the Worlds,3778
36,were some desperate souls even going back towards London to get food.,The War of the Worlds,3779
36,"These were chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge",The War of the Worlds,3780
36,of the Black Smoke came by hearsay.  He heard that about half the,The War of the Worlds,3781
36,"members of the government had gathered at Birmingham, and that",The War of the Worlds,3782
36,enormous quantities of high explosives were being prepared to be used,The War of the Worlds,3783
36,in automatic mines across the Midland counties.,The War of the Worlds,3784
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3785
36,He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the,The War of the Worlds,3786
36,"desertions of the first day's panic, had resumed traffic, and was",The War of the Worlds,3787
36,running northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of,The War of the Worlds,3788
36,the home counties.  There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar,The War of the Worlds,3789
36,announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern,The War of the Worlds,3790
36,towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed,The War of the Worlds,3791
36,among the starving people in the neighbourhood.  But this intelligence,The War of the Worlds,3792
36,"did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three",The War of the Worlds,3793
36,"pressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution",The War of the Worlds,3794
36,"than this promise.  Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear",The War of the Worlds,3795
36,"more of it.  That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose",The War of the Worlds,3796
36,"Hill.  It fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that",The War of the Worlds,3797
36,duty alternately with my brother.  She saw it.,The War of the Worlds,3798
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3799
36,On Wednesday the three fugitives--they had passed the night in a,The War of the Worlds,3800
36,"field of unripe wheat--reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the",The War of the Worlds,3801
36,"inhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the",The War of the Worlds,3802
36,"pony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the",The War of the Worlds,3803
36,promise of a share in it the next day.  Here there were rumours of,The War of the Worlds,3804
36,"Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey",The War of the Worlds,3805
36,Powder Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders.,The War of the Worlds,3806
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3807
36,People were watching for Martians here from the church towers.  My,The War of the Worlds,3808
36,"brother, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at",The War of the Worlds,3809
36,"once to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of",The War of the Worlds,3810
36,"them were very hungry.  By midday they passed through Tillingham,",The War of the Worlds,3811
36,"which, strangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save",The War of the Worlds,3812
36,for a few furtive plunderers hunting for food.  Near Tillingham they,The War of the Worlds,3813
36,"suddenly came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of",The War of the Worlds,3814
36,shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine.,The War of the Worlds,3815
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3816
36,"For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came",The War of the Worlds,3817
36,"on to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and",The War of the Worlds,3818
36,"afterwards to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people.  They",The War of the Worlds,3819
36,lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last,The War of the Worlds,3820
36,towards the Naze.  Close inshore was a multitude of fishing,The War of the Worlds,3821
36,"smacks--English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches",The War of the Worlds,3822
36,"from the Thames, yachts, electric boats; and beyond were ships of large",The War of the Worlds,3823
36,"burden, a multitude of filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships,",The War of the Worlds,3824
36,"passenger boats, petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport",The War of the Worlds,3825
36,"even, neat white and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and",The War of the Worlds,3826
36,along the blue coast across the Blackwater my brother could make out,The War of the Worlds,3827
36,"dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach,",The War of the Worlds,3828
36,a swarm which also extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon.,The War of the Worlds,3829
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3830
36,"About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,",The War of the Worlds,3831
36,"almost, to my brother's perception, like a water-logged ship.  This",The War of the Worlds,3832
36,"was the ram _Thunder Child_.  It was the only warship in sight, but far",The War of the Worlds,3833
36,away to the right over the smooth surface of the sea--for that day,The War of the Worlds,3834
36,there was a dead calm--lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next,The War of the Worlds,3835
36,"ironclads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line,",The War of the Worlds,3836
36,"steam up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the",The War of the Worlds,3837
36,"course of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent",The War of the Worlds,3838
36,it.,The War of the Worlds,3839
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3840
36,"At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the",The War of the Worlds,3841
36,"assurances of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic.  She had never",The War of the Worlds,3842
36,"been out of England before, she would rather die than trust herself",The War of the Worlds,3843
36,"friendless in a foreign country, and so forth.  She seemed, poor woman,",The War of the Worlds,3844
36,to imagine that the French and the Martians might prove very similar.,The War of the Worlds,3845
36,"She had been growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed",The War of the Worlds,3846
36,during the two days' journeyings.  Her great idea was to return to,The War of the Worlds,3847
36,Stanmore.  Things had been always well and safe at Stanmore.  They,The War of the Worlds,3848
36,would find George at Stanmore.,The War of the Worlds,3849
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3850
36,It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the,The War of the Worlds,3851
36,"beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the",The War of the Worlds,3852
36,attention of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames.  They sent,The War of the Worlds,3853
36,a boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three.  The,The War of the Worlds,3854
36,"steamer was going, these men said, to Ostend.",The War of the Worlds,3855
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3856
36,"It was about two o'clock when my brother, having paid their fares",The War of the Worlds,3857
36,"at the gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his",The War of the Worlds,3858
36,"charges.  There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the",The War of the Worlds,3859
36,three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward.,The War of the Worlds,3860
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3861
36,"There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of",The War of the Worlds,3862
36,"whom had expended their last money in securing a passage, but the",The War of the Worlds,3863
36,"captain lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up",The War of the Worlds,3864
36,passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded.  He,The War of the Worlds,3865
36,would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of,The War of the Worlds,3866
36,"guns that began about that hour in the south.  As if in answer, the",The War of the Worlds,3867
36,ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags.  A,The War of the Worlds,3868
36,jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels.,The War of the Worlds,3869
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3870
36,Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from,The War of the Worlds,3871
36,"Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder.  At the",The War of the Worlds,3872
36,"same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three",The War of the Worlds,3873
36,"ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of",The War of the Worlds,3874
36,black smoke.  But my brother's attention speedily reverted to the,The War of the Worlds,3875
36,distant firing in the south.  He fancied he saw a column of smoke,The War of the Worlds,3876
36,rising out of the distant grey haze.,The War of the Worlds,3877
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3878
36,The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big,The War of the Worlds,3879
36,"crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and",The War of the Worlds,3880
36,"hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance,",The War of the Worlds,3881
36,advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness.  At,The War of the Worlds,3882
36,that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear,The War of the Worlds,3883
36,"and anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his",The War of the Worlds,3884
36,terror.  Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of,The War of the Worlds,3885
36,"the steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or",The War of the Worlds,3886
36,"church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human",The War of the Worlds,3887
36,stride.,The War of the Worlds,3888
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3889
36,"It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more",The War of the Worlds,3890
36,"amazed than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately",The War of the Worlds,3891
36,"towards the shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the",The War of the Worlds,3892
36,"coast fell away.  Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another,",The War of the Worlds,3893
36,"striding over some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther",The War of the Worlds,3894
36,"off, wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway",The War of the Worlds,3895
36,"up between sea and sky.  They were all stalking seaward, as if to",The War of the Worlds,3896
36,intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded,The War of the Worlds,3897
36,between Foulness and the Naze.  In spite of the throbbing exertions of,The War of the Worlds,3898
36,"the engines of the little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her",The War of the Worlds,3899
36,"wheels flung behind her, she receded with terrifying slowness from",The War of the Worlds,3900
36,this ominous advance.,The War of the Worlds,3901
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3902
36,"Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of",The War of the Worlds,3903
36,shipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship,The War of the Worlds,3904
36,"passing behind another, another coming round from broadside to end on,",The War of the Worlds,3905
36,"steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let",The War of the Worlds,3906
36,"out, launches rushing hither and thither.  He was so fascinated by",The War of the Worlds,3907
36,this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes,The War of the Worlds,3908
36,for anything seaward.  And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she,The War of the Worlds,3909
36,had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong,The War of the Worlds,3910
36,from the seat upon which he was standing.  There was a shouting all,The War of the Worlds,3911
36,"about him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered",The War of the Worlds,3912
36,faintly.  The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands.,The War of the Worlds,3913
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3914
36,"He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards",The War of the Worlds,3915
36,"from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of",The War of the Worlds,3916
36,"a plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge",The War of the Worlds,3917
36,"waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles",The War of the Worlds,3918
36,"helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the",The War of the Worlds,3919
36,waterline.,The War of the Worlds,3920
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3921
36,A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment.  When his eyes,The War of the Worlds,3922
36,were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing,The War of the Worlds,3923
36,"landward.  Big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure,",The War of the Worlds,3924
36,and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot,The War of the Worlds,3925
36,"with fire.  It was the torpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong,",The War of the Worlds,3926
36,coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping.,The War of the Worlds,3927
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3928
36,"Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks,",The War of the Worlds,3929
36,"my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again,",The War of the Worlds,3930
36,"and he saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far",The War of the Worlds,3931
36,out to sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged.,The War of the Worlds,3932
36,"Thus sunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less",The War of the Worlds,3933
36,formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was,The War of the Worlds,3934
36,pitching so helplessly.  It would seem they were regarding this new,The War of the Worlds,3935
36,"antagonist with astonishment.  To their intelligence, it may be, the",The War of the Worlds,3936
36,giant was even such another as themselves.  The _Thunder Child_ fired no,The War of the Worlds,3937
36,"gun, but simply drove full speed towards them.  It was probably her",The War of the Worlds,3938
36,not firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did.  They,The War of the Worlds,3939
36,"did not know what to make of her.  One shell, and they would have sent",The War of the Worlds,3940
36,her to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray.,The War of the Worlds,3941
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3942
36,She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway,The War of the Worlds,3943
36,between the steamboat and the Martians--a diminishing black bulk,The War of the Worlds,3944
36,against the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast.,The War of the Worlds,3945
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3946
36,Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a,The War of the Worlds,3947
36,canister of the black gas at the ironclad.  It hit her larboard side,The War of the Worlds,3948
36,"and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an",The War of the Worlds,3949
36,"unfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear.",The War of the Worlds,3950
36,"To the watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in",The War of the Worlds,3951
36,"their eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians.",The War of the Worlds,3952
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3953
36,They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water,The War of the Worlds,3954
36,"as they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like",The War of the Worlds,3955
36,"generator of the Heat-Ray.  He held it pointing obliquely downward,",The War of the Worlds,3956
36,and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch.  It must have,The War of the Worlds,3957
36,driven through the iron of the ship's side like a white-hot iron rod,The War of the Worlds,3958
36,through paper.,The War of the Worlds,3959
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3960
36,"A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the",The War of the Worlds,3961
36,"Martian reeled and staggered.  In another moment he was cut down, and",The War of the Worlds,3962
36,a great body of water and steam shot high in the air.  The guns of the,The War of the Worlds,3963
36,"_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the other,",The War of the Worlds,3964
36,"and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer, ricocheted",The War of the Worlds,3965
36,"towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a smack to",The War of the Worlds,3966
36,matchwood.,The War of the Worlds,3967
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3968
36,But no one heeded that very much.  At the sight of the Martian's,The War of the Worlds,3969
36,"collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the",The War of the Worlds,3970
36,crowding passengers on the steamer's stern shouted together.  And then,The War of the Worlds,3971
36,"they yelled again.  For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove",The War of the Worlds,3972
36,"something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts,",The War of the Worlds,3973
36,its ventilators and funnels spouting fire.,The War of the Worlds,3974
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3975
36,"She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and",The War of the Worlds,3976
36,"her engines working.  She headed straight for a second Martian, and",The War of the Worlds,3977
36,was within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear.  Then,The War of the Worlds,3978
36,"with a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped",The War of the Worlds,3979
36,"upward.  The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and",The War of the Worlds,3980
36,"in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the",The War of the Worlds,3981
36,"impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing",The War of the Worlds,3982
36,of cardboard.  My brother shouted involuntarily.  A boiling tumult of,The War of the Worlds,3983
36,steam hid everything again.,The War of the Worlds,3984
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3985
36,"""Two!"" yelled the captain.",The War of the Worlds,3986
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3987
36,Everyone was shouting.  The whole steamer from end to end rang with,The War of the Worlds,3988
36,frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the,The War of the Worlds,3989
36,crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea.,The War of the Worlds,3990
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3991
36,"The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third",The War of the Worlds,3992
36,Martian and the coast altogether.  And all this time the boat was,The War of the Worlds,3993
36,paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last,The War of the Worlds,3994
36,"the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,",The War of the Worlds,3995
36,"and nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the",The War of the Worlds,3996
36,third Martian be seen.  But the ironclads to seaward were now quite,The War of the Worlds,3997
36,close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.,The War of the Worlds,3998
36,"",The War of the Worlds,3999
36,"The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the",The War of the Worlds,4000
36,"ironclads receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by",The War of the Worlds,4001
36,"a marbled bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and",The War of the Worlds,4002
36,combining in the strangest way.  The fleet of refugees was scattering,The War of the Worlds,4003
36,to the northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads,The War of the Worlds,4004
36,"and the steamboat.  After a time, and before they reached the sinking",The War of the Worlds,4005
36,"cloud bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went",The War of the Worlds,4006
36,about and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward.  The,The War of the Worlds,4007
36,"coast grew faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of",The War of the Worlds,4008
36,clouds that were gathering about the sinking sun.,The War of the Worlds,4009
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4010
36,Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the,The War of the Worlds,4011
36,"vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving.  Everyone",The War of the Worlds,4012
36,struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding,The War of the Worlds,4013
36,"furnace of the west, but nothing was to be distinguished clearly.  A",The War of the Worlds,4014
36,mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun.  The,The War of the Worlds,4015
36,steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense.,The War of the Worlds,4016
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4017
36,"The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the",The War of the Worlds,4018
36,evening star trembled into sight.  It was deep twilight when the,The War of the Worlds,4019
36,captain cried out and pointed.  My brother strained his eyes.,The War of the Worlds,4020
36,Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness--rushed,The War of the Worlds,4021
36,slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above,The War of the Worlds,4022
36,"the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very",The War of the Worlds,4023
36,"large, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly,",The War of the Worlds,4024
36,and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night.  And as it flew,The War of the Worlds,4025
36,it rained down darkness upon the land.,The War of the Worlds,4026

36,In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to,The War of the Worlds,4041
36,tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two,The War of the Worlds,4042
36,chapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at,The War of the Worlds,4043
36,Halliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke.  There I will,The War of the Worlds,4044
36,resume.  We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day--the,The War of the Worlds,4045
36,"day of the panic--in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black",The War of the Worlds,4046
36,Smoke from the rest of the world.  We could do nothing but wait in,The War of the Worlds,4047
36,aching inactivity during those two weary days.,The War of the Worlds,4048
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4049
36,My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife.  I figured her at,The War of the Worlds,4050
36,"Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man.",The War of the Worlds,4051
36,I paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off,The War of the Worlds,4052
36,"from her, of all that might happen to her in my absence.  My cousin I",The War of the Worlds,4053
36,"knew was brave enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of",The War of the Worlds,4054
36,"man to realise danger quickly, to rise promptly.  What was needed now",The War of the Worlds,4055
36,"was not bravery, but circumspection.  My only consolation was to",The War of the Worlds,4056
36,believe that the Martians were moving London-ward and away from her.,The War of the Worlds,4057
36,Such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful.  I grew very,The War of the Worlds,4058
36,weary and irritable with the curate's perpetual ejaculations; I tired,The War of the Worlds,4059
36,of the sight of his selfish despair.  After some ineffectual,The War of the Worlds,4060
36,"remonstrance I kept away from him, staying in a room--evidently a",The War of the Worlds,4061
36,"children's schoolroom--containing globes, forms, and copybooks.  When",The War of the Worlds,4062
36,"he followed me thither, I went to a box room at the top of the house",The War of the Worlds,4063
36,"and, in order to be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in.",The War of the Worlds,4064
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4065
36,We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and,The War of the Worlds,4066
36,the morning of the next.  There were signs of people in the next house,The War of the Worlds,4067
36,"on Sunday evening--a face at a window and moving lights, and later the",The War of the Worlds,4068
36,"slamming of a door.  But I do not know who these people were, nor what",The War of the Worlds,4069
36,became of them.  We saw nothing of them next day.  The Black Smoke,The War of the Worlds,4070
36,"drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer",The War of the Worlds,4071
36,"and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house",The War of the Worlds,4072
36,that hid us.,The War of the Worlds,4073
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4074
36,"A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff",The War of the Worlds,4075
36,"with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed",The War of the Worlds,4076
36,"all the windows it touched, and scalded the curate's hand as he fled",The War of the Worlds,4077
36,out of the front room.  When at last we crept across the sodden rooms,The War of the Worlds,4078
36,"and looked out again, the country northward was as though a black",The War of the Worlds,4079
36,"snowstorm had passed over it.  Looking towards the river, we were",The War of the Worlds,4080
36,astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of,The War of the Worlds,4081
36,the scorched meadows.,The War of the Worlds,4082
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4083
36,"For a time we did not see how this change affected our position,",The War of the Worlds,4084
36,save that we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke.  But later,The War of the Worlds,4085
36,"I perceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get",The War of the Worlds,4086
36,"away.  So soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream",The War of the Worlds,4087
36,"of action returned.  But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable.",The War of the Worlds,4088
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4089
36,"""We are safe here,"" he repeated; ""safe here.""",The War of the Worlds,4090
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4091
36,I resolved to leave him--would that I had!  Wiser now for the,The War of the Worlds,4092
36,"artilleryman's teaching, I sought out food and drink.  I had found oil",The War of the Worlds,4093
36,"and rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that",The War of the Worlds,4094
36,I found in one of the bedrooms.  When it was clear to him that I meant,The War of the Worlds,4095
36,to go alone--had reconciled myself to going alone--he suddenly roused,The War of the Worlds,4096
36,"himself to come.  And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we",The War of the Worlds,4097
36,"started about five o'clock, as I should judge, along the blackened",The War of the Worlds,4098
36,road to Sunbury.,The War of the Worlds,4099
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4100
36,"In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying",The War of the Worlds,4101
36,"in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and",The War of the Worlds,4102
36,"luggage, all covered thickly with black dust.  That pall of cindery",The War of the Worlds,4103
36,powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii.,The War of the Worlds,4104
36,"We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of",The War of the Worlds,4105
36,"strange and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were",The War of the Worlds,4106
36,relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating,The War of the Worlds,4107
36,"drift.  We went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro",The War of the Worlds,4108
36,"under the chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance",The War of the Worlds,4109
36,"towards Hampton, and so we came to Twickenham.  These were the first",The War of the Worlds,4110
36,people we saw.,The War of the Worlds,4111
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4112
36,Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still,The War of the Worlds,4113
36,"afire.  Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke,",The War of the Worlds,4114
36,"and there were more people about here, though none could give us news.",The War of the Worlds,4115
36,"For the most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull",The War of the Worlds,4116
36,to shift their quarters.  I have an impression that many of the houses,The War of the Worlds,4117
36,"here were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even",The War of the Worlds,4118
36,for flight.  Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along,The War of the Worlds,4119
36,"the road.  I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap,",The War of the Worlds,4120
36,pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts.  We crossed,The War of the Worlds,4121
36,Richmond Bridge about half past eight.  We hurried across the exposed,The War of the Worlds,4122
36,"bridge, of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number",The War of the Worlds,4123
36,"of red masses, some many feet across.  I did not know what these",The War of the Worlds,4124
36,were--there was no time for scrutiny--and I put a more horrible,The War of the Worlds,4125
36,interpretation on them than they deserved.  Here again on the Surrey,The War of the Worlds,4126
36,"side were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies--a heap",The War of the Worlds,4127
36,near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the,The War of the Worlds,4128
36,Martians until we were some way towards Barnes.,The War of the Worlds,4129
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4130
36,We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running,The War of the Worlds,4131
36,"down a side street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed",The War of the Worlds,4132
36,deserted.  Up the hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the,The War of the Worlds,4133
36,town of Richmond there was no trace of the Black Smoke.,The War of the Worlds,4134
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4135
36,"Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people",The War of the Worlds,4136
36,"running, and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in",The War of the Worlds,4137
36,"sight over the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us.  We stood",The War of the Worlds,4138
36,"aghast at our danger, and had the Martian looked down we must",The War of the Worlds,4139
36,immediately have perished.  We were so terrified that we dared not go,The War of the Worlds,4140
36,"on, but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden.  There the curate",The War of the Worlds,4141
36,"crouched, weeping silently, and refusing to stir again.",The War of the Worlds,4142
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4143
36,"But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest,",The War of the Worlds,4144
36,"and in the twilight I ventured out again.  I went through a shrubbery,",The War of the Worlds,4145
36,"and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds,",The War of the Worlds,4146
36,and so emerged upon the road towards Kew.  The curate I left in the,The War of the Worlds,4147
36,"shed, but he came hurrying after me.",The War of the Worlds,4148
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4149
36,That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did.  For it,The War of the Worlds,4150
36,was manifest the Martians were about us.  No sooner had the curate,The War of the Worlds,4151
36,overtaken me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen,The War of the Worlds,4152
36,"before or another, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew",The War of the Worlds,4153
36,Lodge.  Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the,The War of the Worlds,4154
36,"green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian",The War of the Worlds,4155
36,"pursued them.  In three strides he was among them, and they ran",The War of the Worlds,4156
36,radiating from his feet in all directions.  He used no Heat-Ray to,The War of the Worlds,4157
36,"destroy them, but picked them up one by one.  Apparently he tossed",The War of the Worlds,4158
36,"them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much",The War of the Worlds,4159
36,as a workman's basket hangs over his shoulder.,The War of the Worlds,4160
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4161
36,It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any,The War of the Worlds,4162
36,other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity.  We stood for a,The War of the Worlds,4163
36,"moment petrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a",The War of the Worlds,4164
36,"walled garden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and",The War of the Worlds,4165
36,"lay there, scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were",The War of the Worlds,4166
36,out.,The War of the Worlds,4167
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4168
36,I suppose it was nearly eleven o'clock before we gathered courage,The War of the Worlds,4169
36,"to start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along",The War of the Worlds,4170
36,"hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the",The War of the Worlds,4171
36,"darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who",The War of the Worlds,4172
36,seemed to be all about us.  In one place we blundered upon a scorched,The War of the Worlds,4173
36,"and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered",The War of the Worlds,4174
36,"dead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but",The War of the Worlds,4175
36,"with their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty",The War of the Worlds,4176
36,"feet, perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun",The War of the Worlds,4177
36,carriages.,The War of the Worlds,4178
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4179
36,"Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent",The War of the Worlds,4180
36,"and deserted.  Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too",The War of the Worlds,4181
36,dark for us to see into the side roads of the place.  In Sheen my,The War of the Worlds,4182
36,"companion suddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided",The War of the Worlds,4183
36,to try one of the houses.,The War of the Worlds,4184
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4185
36,"The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the",The War of the Worlds,4186
36,"window, was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable",The War of the Worlds,4187
36,"left in the place but some mouldy cheese.  There was, however, water",The War of the Worlds,4188
36,"to drink; and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our",The War of the Worlds,4189
36,next house-breaking.,The War of the Worlds,4190
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4191
36,We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake.,The War of the Worlds,4192
36,"Here there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the",The War of the Worlds,4193
36,pantry of this domicile we found a store of food--two loaves of bread,The War of the Worlds,4194
36,"in a pan, an uncooked steak, and the half of a ham.  I give this",The War of the Worlds,4195
36,"catalogue so precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to",The War of the Worlds,4196
36,subsist upon this store for the next fortnight.  Bottled beer stood,The War of the Worlds,4197
36,"under a shelf, and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp",The War of the Worlds,4198
36,"lettuces.  This pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in",The War of the Worlds,4199
36,"this was firewood; there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly",The War of the Worlds,4200
36,"a dozen of burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of",The War of the Worlds,4201
36,biscuits.,The War of the Worlds,4202
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4203
36,We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark--for we dared not strike,The War of the Worlds,4204
36,"a light--and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle.",The War of the Worlds,4205
36,"The curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly",The War of the Worlds,4206
36,"enough, for pushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength",The War of the Worlds,4207
36,by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us.,The War of the Worlds,4208
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4209
36,"""It can't be midnight yet,"" I said, and then came a blinding glare",The War of the Worlds,4210
36,"of vivid green light.  Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly",The War of the Worlds,4211
36,"visible in green and black, and vanished again.  And then followed such",The War of the Worlds,4212
36,a concussion as I have never heard before or since.  So close on the,The War of the Worlds,4213
36,"heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash",The War of the Worlds,4214
36,"of glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the",The War of the Worlds,4215
36,"plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of",The War of the Worlds,4216
36,fragments upon our heads.  I was knocked headlong across the floor,The War of the Worlds,4217
36,against the oven handle and stunned.  I was insensible for a long,The War of the Worlds,4218
36,"time, the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness",The War of the Worlds,4219
36,"again, and he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from",The War of the Worlds,4220
36,"a cut forehead, was dabbing water over me.",The War of the Worlds,4221
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4222
36,For some time I could not recollect what had happened.  Then things,The War of the Worlds,4223
36,came to me slowly.  A bruise on my temple asserted itself.,The War of the Worlds,4224
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4225
36,"""Are you better?"" asked the curate in a whisper.",The War of the Worlds,4226
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4227
36,At last I answered him.  I sat up.,The War of the Worlds,4228
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4229
36,"""Don't move,"" he said.  ""The floor is covered with smashed crockery",The War of the Worlds,4230
36,"from the dresser.  You can't possibly move without making a noise, and",The War of the Worlds,4231
36,"I fancy _they_ are outside.""",The War of the Worlds,4232
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4233
36,"We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other",The War of the Worlds,4234
36,"breathing.  Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near",The War of the Worlds,4235
36,"us, some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound.",The War of the Worlds,4236
36,"Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle.",The War of the Worlds,4237
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4238
36,"""That!"" said the curate, when presently it happened again.",The War of the Worlds,4239
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4240
36,"""Yes,"" I said.  ""But what is it?""",The War of the Worlds,4241
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4242
36,"""A Martian!"" said the curate.",The War of the Worlds,4243
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4244
36,I listened again.,The War of the Worlds,4245
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4246
36,"""It was not like the Heat-Ray,"" I said, and for a time I was",The War of the Worlds,4247
36,inclined to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled,The War of the Worlds,4248
36,"against the house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of",The War of the Worlds,4249
36,Shepperton Church.,The War of the Worlds,4250
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4251
36,Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or,The War of the Worlds,4252
36,"four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved.  And then the light",The War of the Worlds,4253
36,"filtered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through",The War of the Worlds,4254
36,a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in,The War of the Worlds,4255
36,the wall behind us.  The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for,The War of the Worlds,4256
36,the first time.,The War of the Worlds,4257
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4258
36,"The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which",The War of the Worlds,4259
36,flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our,The War of the Worlds,4260
36,"feet.  Outside, the soil was banked high against the house.  At the",The War of the Worlds,4261
36,top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe.  The floor,The War of the Worlds,4262
36,was littered with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the,The War of the Worlds,4263
36,"house was broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was",The War of the Worlds,4264
36,evident the greater part of the house had collapsed.  Contrasting,The War of the Worlds,4265
36,"vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion,",The War of the Worlds,4266
36,"pale green, and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the",The War of the Worlds,4267
36,"wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured",The War of the Worlds,4268
36,supplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range.,The War of the Worlds,4269
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4270
36,"As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the",The War of the Worlds,4271
36,"body of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still",The War of the Worlds,4272
36,glowing cylinder.  At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as,The War of the Worlds,4273
36,possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the,The War of the Worlds,4274
36,scullery.,The War of the Worlds,4275
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4276
36,Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind.,The War of the Worlds,4277
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4278
36,"""The fifth cylinder,"" I whispered, ""the fifth shot from Mars, has",The War of the Worlds,4279
36,"struck this house and buried us under the ruins!""",The War of the Worlds,4280
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4281
36,"For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:",The War of the Worlds,4282
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4283
36,"""God have mercy upon us!""",The War of the Worlds,4284
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4285
36,I heard him presently whimpering to himself.,The War of the Worlds,4286
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4287
36,Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my,The War of the Worlds,4288
36,"part scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint",The War of the Worlds,4289
36,"light of the kitchen door.  I could just see the curate's face, a dim,",The War of the Worlds,4290
36,"oval shape, and his collar and cuffs.  Outside there began a metallic",The War of the Worlds,4291
36,"hammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet",The War of the Worlds,4292
36,"interval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine.  These noises, for",The War of the Worlds,4293
36,"the most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if",The War of the Worlds,4294
36,anything to increase in number as time wore on.  Presently a measured,The War of the Worlds,4295
36,thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the,The War of the Worlds,4296
36,"vessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued.  Once the",The War of the Worlds,4297
36,"light was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely",The War of the Worlds,4298
36,"dark.  For many hours we must have crouched there, silent and",The War of the Worlds,4299
36,"shivering, until our tired attention failed. . . .",The War of the Worlds,4300
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4301
36,At last I found myself awake and very hungry.  I am inclined to,The War of the Worlds,4302
36,believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that,The War of the Worlds,4303
36,awakening.  My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to,The War of the Worlds,4304
36,"action.  I told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way",The War of the Worlds,4305
36,"towards the pantry.  He made me no answer, but so soon as I began",The War of the Worlds,4306
36,eating the faint noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling,The War of the Worlds,4307
36,after me.,The War of the Worlds,4308
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4309
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4310
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4311
36,CHAPTER TWO,The War of the Worlds,4312
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4313
36,WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSE,The War of the Worlds,4314
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4315
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4316
36,"After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have",The War of the Worlds,4317
36,"dozed again, for when presently I looked round I was alone.  The",The War of the Worlds,4318
36,thudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence.  I whispered,The War of the Worlds,4319
36,"for the curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of",The War of the Worlds,4320
36,"the kitchen.  It was still daylight, and I perceived him across the",The War of the Worlds,4321
36,"room, lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the",The War of the Worlds,4322
36,"Martians.  His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden",The War of the Worlds,4323
36,from me.,The War of the Worlds,4324
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4325
36,I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine,The War of the Worlds,4326
36,shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud.  Through the,The War of the Worlds,4327
36,aperture in the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold,The War of the Worlds,4328
36,and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky.  For a minute or so I,The War of the Worlds,4329
36,"remained watching the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and",The War of the Worlds,4330
36,stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the,The War of the Worlds,4331
36,floor.,The War of the Worlds,4332
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4333
36,"I touched the curate's leg, and he started so violently that a mass",The War of the Worlds,4334
36,of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact.  I,The War of the Worlds,4335
36,"gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we",The War of the Worlds,4336
36,crouched motionless.  Then I turned to see how much of our rampart,The War of the Worlds,4337
36,remained.  The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open,The War of the Worlds,4338
36,"in the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was",The War of the Worlds,4339
36,able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet,The War of the Worlds,4340
36,"suburban roadway.  Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.",The War of the Worlds,4341
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4342
36,The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the,The War of the Worlds,4343
36,"house we had first visited.  The building had vanished, completely",The War of the Worlds,4344
36,"smashed, pulverised, and dispersed by the blow.  The cylinder lay now",The War of the Worlds,4345
36,"far beneath the original foundations--deep in a hole, already vastly",The War of the Worlds,4346
36,larger than the pit I had looked into at Woking.  The earth all round,The War of the Worlds,4347
36,"it had splashed under that tremendous impact--""splashed"" is the only",The War of the Worlds,4348
36,word--and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent,The War of the Worlds,4349
36,houses.  It had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of a,The War of the Worlds,4350
36,"hammer.  Our house had collapsed backward; the front portion, even on",The War of the Worlds,4351
36,"the ground floor, had been destroyed completely; by a chance the",The War of the Worlds,4352
36,"kitchen and scullery had escaped, and stood buried now under soil and",The War of the Worlds,4353
36,"ruins, closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards the",The War of the Worlds,4354
36,cylinder.  Over that aspect we hung now on the very edge of the great,The War of the Worlds,4355
36,circular pit the Martians were engaged in making.  The heavy beating,The War of the Worlds,4356
36,"sound was evidently just behind us, and ever and again a bright green",The War of the Worlds,4357
36,vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole.,The War of the Worlds,4358
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4359
36,"The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on",The War of the Worlds,4360
36,"the farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped",The War of the Worlds,4361
36,"shrubbery, one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its",The War of the Worlds,4362
36,"occupant, stood stiff and tall against the evening sky.  At first I",The War of the Worlds,4363
36,"scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder, although it has been",The War of the Worlds,4364
36,"convenient to describe them first, on account of the extraordinary",The War of the Worlds,4365
36,"glittering mechanism I saw busy in the excavation, and on account of",The War of the Worlds,4366
36,the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across,The War of the Worlds,4367
36,the heaped mould near it.,The War of the Worlds,4368
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4369
36,The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first.  It,The War of the Worlds,4370
36,was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been called,The War of the Worlds,4371
36,"handling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an",The War of the Worlds,4372
36,enormous impetus to terrestrial invention.  As it dawned upon me,The War of the Worlds,4373
36,"first, it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed,",The War of the Worlds,4374
36,"agile legs, and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars,",The War of the Worlds,4375
36,and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body.  Most of its,The War of the Worlds,4376
36,"arms were retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing",The War of the Worlds,4377
36,"out a number of rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and",The War of the Worlds,4378
36,"apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder.  These, as it",The War of the Worlds,4379
36,"extracted them, were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface",The War of the Worlds,4380
36,of earth behind it.,The War of the Worlds,4381
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4382
36,"Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did",The War of the Worlds,4383
36,"not see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter.  The",The War of the Worlds,4384
36,fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary,The War of the Worlds,4385
36,"pitch, but nothing to compare with this.  People who have never seen",The War of the Worlds,4386
36,"these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or",The War of the Worlds,4387
36,"the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,",The War of the Worlds,4388
36,scarcely realise that living quality.,The War of the Worlds,4389
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4390
36,I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first,The War of the Worlds,4391
36,pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war.  The artist had,The War of the Worlds,4392
36,"evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and",The War of the Worlds,4393
36,"there his knowledge ended.  He presented them as tilted, stiff",The War of the Worlds,4394
36,"tripods, without either flexibility or subtlety, and with an",The War of the Worlds,4395
36,altogether misleading monotony of effect.  The pamphlet containing,The War of the Worlds,4396
36,"these renderings had a considerable vogue, and I mention them here",The War of the Worlds,4397
36,simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have,The War of the Worlds,4398
36,created.  They were no more like the Martians I saw in action than a,The War of the Worlds,4399
36,"Dutch doll is like a human being.  To my mind, the pamphlet would have",The War of the Worlds,4400
36,been much better without them.,The War of the Worlds,4401
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4402
36,"At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a",The War of the Worlds,4403
36,"machine, but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the",The War of the Worlds,4404
36,controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements,The War of the Worlds,4405
36,seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab's cerebral portion.,The War of the Worlds,4406
36,"But then I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny,",The War of the Worlds,4407
36,"leathery integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and",The War of the Worlds,4408
36,the true nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me.  With that,The War of the Worlds,4409
36,"realisation my interest shifted to those other creatures, the real",The War of the Worlds,4410
36,"Martians.  Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the",The War of the Worlds,4411
36,"first nausea no longer obscured my observation.  Moreover, I was",The War of the Worlds,4412
36,"concealed and motionless, and under no urgency of action.",The War of the Worlds,4413
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4414
36,"They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible",The War of the Worlds,4415
36,"to conceive.  They were huge round bodies--or, rather, heads--about",The War of the Worlds,4416
36,"four feet in diameter, each body having in front of it a face.  This",The War of the Worlds,4417
36,"face had no nostrils--indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any",The War of the Worlds,4418
36,"sense of smell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes,",The War of the Worlds,4419
36,and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak.  In the back of this head,The War of the Worlds,4420
36,or body--I scarcely know how to speak of it--was the single tight,The War of the Worlds,4421
36,"tympanic surface, since known to be anatomically an ear, though it",The War of the Worlds,4422
36,must have been almost useless in our dense air.  In a group round the,The War of the Worlds,4423
36,"mouth were sixteen slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two",The War of the Worlds,4424
36,bunches of eight each.  These bunches have since been named rather,The War of the Worlds,4425
36,"aptly, by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_.",The War of the Worlds,4426
36,Even as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to be,The War of the Worlds,4427
36,"endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with",The War of the Worlds,4428
36,"the increased weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible.",The War of the Worlds,4429
36,There is reason to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon,The War of the Worlds,4430
36,them with some facility.,The War of the Worlds,4431
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4432
36,"The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since",The War of the Worlds,4433
36,"shown, was almost equally simple.  The greater part of the structure",The War of the Worlds,4434
36,"was the brain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile",The War of the Worlds,4435
36,"tentacles.  Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth",The War of the Worlds,4436
36,"opened, and the heart and its vessels.  The pulmonary distress caused",The War of the Worlds,4437
36,by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only,The War of the Worlds,4438
36,too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin.,The War of the Worlds,4439
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4440
36,And this was the sum of the Martian organs.  Strange as it may seem,The War of the Worlds,4441
36,"to a human being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes",The War of the Worlds,4442
36,"up the bulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians.  They were",The War of the Worlds,4443
36,"heads--merely heads.  Entrails they had none.  They did not eat, much",The War of the Worlds,4444
36,"less digest.  Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other",The War of the Worlds,4445
36,"creatures, and _injected_ it into their own veins.  I have myself seen",The War of the Worlds,4446
36,"this being done, as I shall mention in its place.  But, squeamish as I",The War of the Worlds,4447
36,"may seem, I cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure",The War of the Worlds,4448
36,"even to continue watching.  Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from",The War of the Worlds,4449
36,"a still living animal, in most cases from a human being, was run",The War of the Worlds,4450
36,directly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . .,The War of the Worlds,4451
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4452
36,"The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at",The War of the Worlds,4453
36,the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our,The War of the Worlds,4454
36,carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.,The War of the Worlds,4455
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4456
36,The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are,The War of the Worlds,4457
36,"undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and",The War of the Worlds,4458
36,energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process.  Our bodies are,The War of the Worlds,4459
36,"half made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning",The War of the Worlds,4460
36,heterogeneous food into blood.  The digestive processes and their,The War of the Worlds,4461
36,reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our,The War of the Worlds,4462
36,minds.  Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy,The War of the Worlds,4463
36,"livers, or sound gastric glands.  But the Martians were lifted above",The War of the Worlds,4464
36,all these organic fluctuations of mood and emotion.,The War of the Worlds,4465
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4466
36,Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment,The War of the Worlds,4467
36,is partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they,The War of the Worlds,4468
36,"had brought with them as provisions from Mars.  These creatures, to",The War of the Worlds,4469
36,"judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands,",The War of the Worlds,4470
36,"were bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the",The War of the Worlds,4471
36,"silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet",The War of the Worlds,4472
36,"high and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets.",The War of the Worlds,4473
36,"Two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and",The War of the Worlds,4474
36,all were killed before earth was reached.  It was just as well for,The War of the Worlds,4475
36,"them, for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have",The War of the Worlds,4476
36,broken every bone in their bodies.,The War of the Worlds,4477
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4478
36,"And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place",The War of the Worlds,4479
36,"certain further details which, although they were not all evident to",The War of the Worlds,4480
36,"us at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them",The War of the Worlds,4481
36,to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures.,The War of the Worlds,4482
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4483
36,In three other points their physiology differed strangely from,The War of the Worlds,4484
36,"ours.  Their organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man",The War of the Worlds,4485
36,"sleeps.  Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate,",The War of the Worlds,4486
36,that periodical extinction was unknown to them.  They had little or,The War of the Worlds,4487
36,"no sense of fatigue, it would seem.  On earth they could never have",The War of the Worlds,4488
36,"moved without effort, yet even to the last they kept in action.  In",The War of the Worlds,4489
36,"twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth",The War of the Worlds,4490
36,is perhaps the case with the ants.,The War of the Worlds,4491
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4492
36,"In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the",The War of the Worlds,4493
36,"Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the",The War of the Worlds,4494
36,tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men.  A,The War of the Worlds,4495
36,"young Martian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth",The War of the Worlds,4496
36,"during the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially",The War of the Worlds,4497
36,"_budded_ off, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animals",The War of the Worlds,4498
36,in the fresh-water polyp.,The War of the Worlds,4499
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4500
36,"In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of",The War of the Worlds,4501
36,increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the,The War of the Worlds,4502
36,"primitive method.  Among the lower animals, up even to those first",The War of the Worlds,4503
36,"cousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processes",The War of the Worlds,4504
36,"occur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded its",The War of the Worlds,4505
36,"competitor altogether.  On Mars, however, just the reverse has",The War of the Worlds,4506
36,apparently been the case.,The War of the Worlds,4507
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4508
36,It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of,The War of the Worlds,4509
36,"quasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did",The War of the Worlds,4510
36,forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian,The War of the Worlds,4511
36,"condition.  His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or",The War of the Worlds,4512
36,"December, 1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_,",The War of the Worlds,4513
36,and I recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called,The War of the Worlds,4514
36,"_Punch_.  He pointed out--writing in a foolish, facetious tone--that the",The War of the Worlds,4515
36,perfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs;,The War of the Worlds,4516
36,"the perfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as",The War of the Worlds,4517
36,"hair, external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential",The War of the Worlds,4518
36,"parts of the human being, and that the tendency of natural selection",The War of the Worlds,4519
36,would lie in the direction of their steady diminution through the,The War of the Worlds,4520
36,coming ages.  The brain alone remained a cardinal necessity.  Only one,The War of the Worlds,4521
36,"other part of the body had a strong case for survival, and that was",The War of the Worlds,4522
36,"the hand, ""teacher and agent of the brain.""  While the rest of the",The War of the Worlds,4523
36,"body dwindled, the hands would grow larger.",The War of the Worlds,4524
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4525
36,"There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians",The War of the Worlds,4526
36,we have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression,The War of the Worlds,4527
36,of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence.  To me it is,The War of the Worlds,4528
36,quite credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not,The War of the Worlds,4529
36,"unlike ourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the",The War of the Worlds,4530
36,latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last),The War of the Worlds,4531
36,at the expense of the rest of the body.  Without the body the brain,The War of the Worlds,4532
36,"would, of course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any of",The War of the Worlds,4533
36,the emotional substratum of the human being.,The War of the Worlds,4534
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4535
36,The last salient point in which the systems of these creatures,The War of the Worlds,4536
36,differed from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial,The War of the Worlds,4537
36,"particular.  Micro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain on",The War of the Worlds,4538
36,"earth, have either never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary",The War of the Worlds,4539
36,"science eliminated them ages ago.  A hundred diseases, all the fevers",The War of the Worlds,4540
36,"and contagions of human life, consumption, cancers, tumours and such",The War of the Worlds,4541
36,"morbidities, never enter the scheme of their life.  And speaking of",The War of the Worlds,4542
36,"the differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may",The War of the Worlds,4543
36,allude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed.,The War of the Worlds,4544
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4545
36,"Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green",The War of the Worlds,4546
36,"for a dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint.  At any rate, the",The War of the Worlds,4547
36,seeds which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with,The War of the Worlds,4548
36,them gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths.  Only that known,The War of the Worlds,4549
36,"popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition",The War of the Worlds,4550
36,with terrestrial forms.  The red creeper was quite a transitory,The War of the Worlds,4551
36,"growth, and few people have seen it growing.  For a time, however, the",The War of the Worlds,4552
36,red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance.  It spread up,The War of the Worlds,4553
36,"the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment,",The War of the Worlds,4554
36,and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of,The War of the Worlds,4555
36,our triangular window.  And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout,The War of the Worlds,4556
36,"the country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water.",The War of the Worlds,4557
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4558
36,"The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a",The War of the Worlds,4559
36,"single round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual",The War of the Worlds,4560
36,"range not very different from ours except that, according to Philips,",The War of the Worlds,4561
36,blue and violet were as black to them.  It is commonly supposed that,The War of the Worlds,4562
36,they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is,The War of the Worlds,4563
36,"asserted, for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet",The War of the Worlds,4564
36,(written evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions),The War of the Worlds,4565
36,"to which I have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief",The War of the Worlds,4566
36,source of information concerning them.  Now no surviving human being,The War of the Worlds,4567
36,saw so much of the Martians in action as I did.  I take no credit to,The War of the Worlds,4568
36,"myself for an accident, but the fact is so.  And I assert that I",The War of the Worlds,4569
36,"watched them closely time after time, and that I have seen four, five,",The War of the Worlds,4570
36,and (once) six of them sluggishly performing the most elaborately,The War of the Worlds,4571
36,complicated operations together without either sound or gesture.  Their,The War of the Worlds,4572
36,"peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation,",The War of the Worlds,4573
36,"and was, I believe, in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of",The War of the Worlds,4574
36,air preparatory to the suctional operation.  I have a certain claim to,The War of the Worlds,4575
36,"at least an elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I",The War of the Worlds,4576
36,am convinced--as firmly as I am convinced of anything--that the,The War of the Worlds,4577
36,Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation.,The War of the Worlds,4578
36,And I have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions.,The War of the Worlds,4579
36,"Before the Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may",The War of the Worlds,4580
36,"remember, I had written with some little vehemence against the",The War of the Worlds,4581
36,telepathic theory.,The War of the Worlds,4582
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4583
36,The Martians wore no clothing.  Their conceptions of ornament and,The War of the Worlds,4584
36,decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they,The War of the Worlds,4585
36,"evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are,",The War of the Worlds,4586
36,but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at,The War of the Worlds,4587
36,"all seriously.  Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other",The War of the Worlds,4588
36,artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great,The War of the Worlds,4589
36,"superiority over man lay.  We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,",The War of the Worlds,4590
36,"our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are",The War of the Worlds,4591
36,just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked,The War of the Worlds,4592
36,"out.  They have become practically mere brains, wearing different",The War of the Worlds,4593
36,bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and,The War of the Worlds,4594
36,take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet.  And of their,The War of the Worlds,4595
36,"appliances, perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the",The War of the Worlds,4596
36,curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human,The War of the Worlds,4597
36,devices in mechanism is absent--the _wheel_ is absent; among all the,The War of the Worlds,4598
36,things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their,The War of the Worlds,4599
36,use of wheels.  One would have at least expected it in locomotion.  And,The War of the Worlds,4600
36,in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earth,The War of the Worlds,4601
36,"Nature has never hit upon the wheel, or has preferred other expedients",The War of the Worlds,4602
36,to its development.  And not only did the Martians either not know of,The War of the Worlds,4603
36,"(which is incredible), or abstain from, the wheel, but in their",The War of the Worlds,4604
36,apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot or,The War of the Worlds,4605
36,"relatively fixed pivot, with circular motions thereabout confined",The War of the Worlds,4606
36,to one plane.  Almost all the joints of the machinery present a,The War of the Worlds,4607
36,complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully,The War of the Worlds,4608
36,"curved friction bearings.  And while upon this matter of detail, it is",The War of the Worlds,4609
36,remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases,The War of the Worlds,4610
36,actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic,The War of the Worlds,4611
36,sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully,The War of the Worlds,4612
36,together when traversed by a current of electricity.  In this way the,The War of the Worlds,4613
36,"curious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking and",The War of the Worlds,4614
36,"disturbing to the human beholder, was attained.  Such quasi-muscles",The War of the Worlds,4615
36,"abounded in the crablike handling-machine which, on my first peeping",The War of the Worlds,4616
36,"out of the slit, I watched unpacking the cylinder.  It seemed",The War of the Worlds,4617
36,infinitely more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in the,The War of the Worlds,4618
36,"sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving",The War of the Worlds,4619
36,feebly after their vast journey across space.,The War of the Worlds,4620
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4621
36,"While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight,",The War of the Worlds,4622
36,"and noting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me",The War of the Worlds,4623
36,of his presence by pulling violently at my arm.  I turned to a,The War of the Worlds,4624
36,"scowling face, and silent, eloquent lips.  He wanted the slit, which",The War of the Worlds,4625
36,permitted only one of us to peep through; and so I had to forego,The War of the Worlds,4626
36,watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege.,The War of the Worlds,4627
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4628
36,"When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put",The War of the Worlds,4629
36,together several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the,The War of the Worlds,4630
36,cylinder into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and,The War of the Worlds,4631
36,"down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view,",The War of the Worlds,4632
36,"emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit,",The War of the Worlds,4633
36,excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner.,The War of the Worlds,4634
36,"This it was which had caused the regular beating noise, and the",The War of the Worlds,4635
36,rhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quivering.  It piped,The War of the Worlds,4636
36,"and whistled as it worked.  So far as I could see, the thing was",The War of the Worlds,4637
36,without a directing Martian at all.,The War of the Worlds,4638

36,"",The War of the Worlds,4645
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4646
36,The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole,The War of the Worlds,4647
36,"into the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian",The War of the Worlds,4648
36,might see down upon us behind our barrier.  At a later date we began,The War of the Worlds,4649
36,"to feel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of",The War of the Worlds,4650
36,"the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but at",The War of the Worlds,4651
36,first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery,The War of the Worlds,4652
36,in heart-throbbing retreat.  Yet terrible as was the danger we,The War of the Worlds,4653
36,"incurred, the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible.",The War of the Worlds,4654
36,"And I recall now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite",The War of the Worlds,4655
36,danger in which we were between starvation and a still more terrible,The War of the Worlds,4656
36,"death, we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of",The War of the Worlds,4657
36,sight.  We would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between,The War of the Worlds,4658
36,"eagerness and the dread of making a noise, and strike each other, and",The War of the Worlds,4659
36,"thrust and kick, within a few inches of exposure.",The War of the Worlds,4660
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4661
36,The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and,The War of the Worlds,4662
36,"habits of thought and action, and our danger and isolation only",The War of the Worlds,4663
36,accentuated the incompatibility.  At Halliford I had already come to,The War of the Worlds,4664
36,"hate the curate's trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity",The War of the Worlds,4665
36,of mind.  His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made,The War of the Worlds,4666
36,"to think out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and",The War of the Worlds,4667
36,"intensified, almost to the verge of craziness.  He was as lacking in",The War of the Worlds,4668
36,"restraint as a silly woman.  He would weep for hours together, and I",The War of the Worlds,4669
36,verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought,The War of the Worlds,4670
36,his weak tears in some way efficacious.  And I would sit in the,The War of the Worlds,4671
36,darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his,The War of the Worlds,4672
36,"importunities.  He ate more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed",The War of the Worlds,4673
36,out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the,The War of the Worlds,4674
36,"Martians had done with their pit, that in that long patience a time",The War of the Worlds,4675
36,might presently come when we should need food.  He ate and drank,The War of the Worlds,4676
36,impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals.  He slept little.,The War of the Worlds,4677
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4678
36,"As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so",The War of the Worlds,4679
36,"intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed",The War of the Worlds,4680
36,"doing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows.  That brought him",The War of the Worlds,4681
36,"to reason for a time.  But he was one of those weak creatures, void of",The War of the Worlds,4682
36,"pride, timorous, anaemic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, who",The War of the Worlds,4683
36,"face neither God nor man, who face not even themselves.",The War of the Worlds,4684
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4685
36,"It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I",The War of the Worlds,4686
36,set them down that my story may lack nothing.  Those who have escaped,The War of the Worlds,4687
36,"the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash",The War of the Worlds,4688
36,"of rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what",The War of the Worlds,4689
36,"is wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men.  But",The War of the Worlds,4690
36,"those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to",The War of the Worlds,4691
36,"elemental things, will have a wider charity.",The War of the Worlds,4692
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4693
36,"And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,",The War of the Worlds,4694
36,"snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in the",The War of the Worlds,4695
36,"pitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, the",The War of the Worlds,4696
36,unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit.  Let me return to those,The War of the Worlds,4697
36,first new experiences of mine.  After a long time I ventured back to,The War of the Worlds,4698
36,"the peephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the",The War of the Worlds,4699
36,occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines.  These last,The War of the Worlds,4700
36,had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an,The War of the Worlds,4701
36,orderly manner about the cylinder.  The second handling-machine was now,The War of the Worlds,4702
36,"completed, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the",The War of the Worlds,4703
36,big machine had brought.  This was a body resembling a milk can in its,The War of the Worlds,4704
36,"general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and",The War of the Worlds,4705
36,from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin,The War of the Worlds,4706
36,below.,The War of the Worlds,4707
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4708
36,The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the,The War of the Worlds,4709
36,handling-machine.  With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was,The War of the Worlds,4710
36,digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped,The War of the Worlds,4711
36,"receptacle above, while with another arm it periodically opened a door",The War of the Worlds,4712
36,and removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the,The War of the Worlds,4713
36,machine.  Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin,The War of the Worlds,4714
36,along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me,The War of the Worlds,4715
36,by the mound of bluish dust.  From this unseen receiver a little,The War of the Worlds,4716
36,"thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air.  As I looked,",The War of the Worlds,4717
36,"the handling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended,",The War of the Worlds,4718
36,"telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere",The War of the Worlds,4719
36,"blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay.",The War of the Worlds,4720
36,"In another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight,",The War of the Worlds,4721
36,"untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a",The War of the Worlds,4722
36,growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit.  Between,The War of the Worlds,4723
36,sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a,The War of the Worlds,4724
36,"hundred such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust",The War of the Worlds,4725
36,rose steadily until it topped the side of the pit.,The War of the Worlds,4726
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4727
36,The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these,The War of the Worlds,4728
36,contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was,The War of the Worlds,4729
36,"acute, and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter",The War of the Worlds,4730
36,were indeed the living of the two things.,The War of the Worlds,4731
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4732
36,The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were,The War of the Worlds,4733
36,"brought to the pit.  I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with",The War of the Worlds,4734
36,"all my ears.  He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that",The War of the Worlds,4735
36,"we were observed, crouched in a spasm of terror.  He came sliding down",The War of the Worlds,4736
36,"the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,",The War of the Worlds,4737
36,"gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic.  His gesture",The War of the Worlds,4738
36,"suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my",The War of the Worlds,4739
36,"curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and",The War of the Worlds,4740
36,clambered up to it.  At first I could see no reason for his frantic,The War of the Worlds,4741
36,"behaviour.  The twilight had now come, the stars were little and",The War of the Worlds,4742
36,"faint, but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that",The War of the Worlds,4743
36,came from the aluminium-making.  The whole picture was a flickering,The War of the Worlds,4744
36,"scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely",The War of the Worlds,4745
36,"trying to the eyes.  Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it",The War of the Worlds,4746
36,"not at all.  The sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the",The War of the Worlds,4747
36,"mound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a",The War of the Worlds,4748
36,"fighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated,",The War of the Worlds,4749
36,"stood across the corner of the pit.  And then, amid the clangour of",The War of the Worlds,4750
36,"the machinery, came a drifting suspicion of human voices, that I",The War of the Worlds,4751
36,entertained at first only to dismiss.,The War of the Worlds,4752
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4753
36,"I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying",The War of the Worlds,4754
36,myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a,The War of the Worlds,4755
36,Martian.  As the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of,The War of the Worlds,4756
36,his integument and the brightness of his eyes.  And suddenly I heard,The War of the Worlds,4757
36,"a yell, and saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the",The War of the Worlds,4758
36,machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back.  Then,The War of the Worlds,4759
36,something--something struggling violently--was lifted high against the,The War of the Worlds,4760
36,"sky, a black, vague enigma against the starlight; and as this black",The War of the Worlds,4761
36,"object came down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was a",The War of the Worlds,4762
36,"man.  For an instant he was clearly visible.  He was a stout, ruddy,",The War of the Worlds,4763
36,"middle-aged man, well dressed; three days before, he must have been",The War of the Worlds,4764
36,"walking the world, a man of considerable consequence.  I could see his",The War of the Worlds,4765
36,staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain.  He,The War of the Worlds,4766
36,"vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence.  And",The War of the Worlds,4767
36,then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the,The War of the Worlds,4768
36,Martians.,The War of the Worlds,4769
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4770
36,"I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands",The War of the Worlds,4771
36,"over my ears, and bolted into the scullery.  The curate, who had been",The War of the Worlds,4772
36,"crouching silently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed,",The War of the Worlds,4773
36,"cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after",The War of the Worlds,4774
36,me.,The War of the Worlds,4775
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4776
36,"That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our",The War of the Worlds,4777
36,"horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt",The War of the Worlds,4778
36,an urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of,The War of the Worlds,4779
36,"escape; but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider",The War of the Worlds,4780
36,"our position with great clearness.  The curate, I found, was quite",The War of the Worlds,4781
36,incapable of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed,The War of the Worlds,4782
36,him of all vestiges of reason or forethought.  Practically he had,The War of the Worlds,4783
36,"already sunk to the level of an animal.  But as the saying goes, I",The War of the Worlds,4784
36,"gripped myself with both hands.  It grew upon my mind, once I could",The War of the Worlds,4785
36,"face the facts, that terrible as our position was, there was as yet",The War of the Worlds,4786
36,no justification for absolute despair.  Our chief chance lay in the,The War of the Worlds,4787
36,possibility of the Martians making the pit nothing more than a,The War of the Worlds,4788
36,"temporary encampment.  Or even if they kept it permanently, they might",The War of the Worlds,4789
36,"not consider it necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape might be",The War of the Worlds,4790
36,afforded us.  I also weighed very carefully the possibility of our,The War of the Worlds,4791
36,"digging a way out in a direction away from the pit, but the chances of",The War of the Worlds,4792
36,our emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at,The War of the Worlds,4793
36,first too great.  And I should have had to do all the digging myself.,The War of the Worlds,4794
36,The curate would certainly have failed me.,The War of the Worlds,4795
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4796
36,"It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw",The War of the Worlds,4797
36,the lad killed.  It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the,The War of the Worlds,4798
36,Martians feed.  After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall,The War of the Worlds,4799
36,"for the better part of a day.  I went into the scullery, removed the",The War of the Worlds,4800
36,"door, and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as",The War of the Worlds,4801
36,possible; but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the,The War of the Worlds,4802
36,"loose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue.  I lost",The War of the Worlds,4803
36,"heart, and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time, having no",The War of the Worlds,4804
36,spirit even to move.  And after that I abandoned altogether the idea,The War of the Worlds,4805
36,of escaping by excavation.,The War of the Worlds,4806
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4807
36,It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that,The War of the Worlds,4808
36,at first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought,The War of the Worlds,4809
36,about by their overthrow through any human effort.  But on the fourth,The War of the Worlds,4810
36,or fifth night I heard a sound like heavy guns.,The War of the Worlds,4811
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4812
36,"It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly.",The War of the Worlds,4813
36,"The Martians had taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for a",The War of the Worlds,4814
36,fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a,The War of the Worlds,4815
36,handling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the,The War of the Worlds,4816
36,"pit immediately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them.",The War of the Worlds,4817
36,Except for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and,The War of the Worlds,4818
36,"patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for",The War of the Worlds,4819
36,"the clinking of the handling-machine, quite still.  That night was a",The War of the Worlds,4820
36,"beautiful serenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the",The War of the Worlds,4821
36,"sky to herself.  I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was",The War of the Worlds,4822
36,that made me listen.  Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly,The War of the Worlds,4823
36,"like the sound of great guns.  Six distinct reports I counted, and",The War of the Worlds,4824
36,after a long interval six again.  And that was all.,The War of the Worlds,4825

36,THE DEATH OF THE CURATE,The War of the Worlds,4831
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4832
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4833
36,It was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the,The War of the Worlds,4834
36,"last time, and presently found myself alone.  Instead of keeping close",The War of the Worlds,4835
36,"to me and trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone back",The War of the Worlds,4836
36,into the scullery.  I was struck by a sudden thought.  I went back,The War of the Worlds,4837
36,quickly and quietly into the scullery.  In the darkness I heard the,The War of the Worlds,4838
36,"curate drinking.  I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a",The War of the Worlds,4839
36,bottle of burgundy.,The War of the Worlds,4840
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4841
36,For a few minutes there was a tussle.  The bottle struck the floor,The War of the Worlds,4842
36,"and broke, and I desisted and rose.  We stood panting and threatening",The War of the Worlds,4843
36,"each other.  In the end I planted myself between him and the food, and",The War of the Worlds,4844
36,told him of my determination to begin a discipline.  I divided the,The War of the Worlds,4845
36,"food in the pantry, into rations to last us ten days.  I would not let",The War of the Worlds,4846
36,him eat any more that day.  In the afternoon he made a feeble effort,The War of the Worlds,4847
36,"to get at the food.  I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake.",The War of the Worlds,4848
36,"All day and all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and",The War of the Worlds,4849
36,"he weeping and complaining of his immediate hunger.  It was, I know, a",The War of the Worlds,4850
36,"night and a day, but to me it seemed--it seems now--an interminable",The War of the Worlds,4851
36,length of time.,The War of the Worlds,4852
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4853
36,And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict.,The War of the Worlds,4854
36,For two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests.,The War of the Worlds,4855
36,"There were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I",The War of the Worlds,4856
36,"cajoled and persuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last",The War of the Worlds,4857
36,"bottle of burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could",The War of the Worlds,4858
36,get water.  But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed,The War of the Worlds,4859
36,beyond reason.  He would neither desist from his attacks on the food,The War of the Worlds,4860
36,nor from his noisy babbling to himself.  The rudimentary precautions,The War of the Worlds,4861
36,to keep our imprisonment endurable he would not observe.  Slowly I,The War of the Worlds,4862
36,"began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence, to",The War of the Worlds,4863
36,perceive that my sole companion in this close and sickly darkness was,The War of the Worlds,4864
36,a man insane.,The War of the Worlds,4865
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4866
36,From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind,The War of the Worlds,4867
36,wandered at times.  I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept.,The War of the Worlds,4868
36,"It sounds paradoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness",The War of the Worlds,4869
36,"and insanity of the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane",The War of the Worlds,4870
36,man.,The War of the Worlds,4871
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4872
36,"On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and",The War of the Worlds,4873
36,nothing I could do would moderate his speech.,The War of the Worlds,4874
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4875
36,"""It is just, O God!"" he would say, over and over again. ""It is",The War of the Worlds,4876
36,"just.  On me and mine be the punishment laid.  We have sinned, we have",The War of the Worlds,4877
36,"fallen short.  There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in",The War of the Worlds,4878
36,"the dust, and I held my peace.  I preached acceptable folly--my God,",The War of the Worlds,4879
36,"what folly!--when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and",The War of the Worlds,4880
36,called upon them to repent--repent! . . .  Oppressors of the poor and,The War of the Worlds,4881
36,"needy . . . !  The wine press of God!""",The War of the Worlds,4882
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4883
36,Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld,The War of the Worlds,4884
36,"from him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening.  He began to",The War of the Worlds,4885
36,raise his voice--I prayed him not to.  He perceived a hold on me--he,The War of the Worlds,4886
36,threatened he would shout and bring the Martians upon us.  For a time,The War of the Worlds,4887
36,that scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of,The War of the Worlds,4888
36,"escape beyond estimating.  I defied him, although I felt no assurance",The War of the Worlds,4889
36,"that he might not do this thing.  But that day, at any rate, he did",The War of the Worlds,4890
36,"not.  He talked with his voice rising slowly, through the greater part",The War of the Worlds,4891
36,"of the eighth and ninth days--threats, entreaties, mingled with a",The War of the Worlds,4892
36,torrent of half-sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham,The War of the Worlds,4893
36,"of God's service, such as made me pity him.  Then he slept awhile, and",The War of the Worlds,4894
36,"began again with renewed strength, so loudly that I must needs make",The War of the Worlds,4895
36,him desist.,The War of the Worlds,4896
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4897
36,"""Be still!"" I implored.",The War of the Worlds,4898
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4899
36,"He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness near",The War of the Worlds,4900
36,the copper.,The War of the Worlds,4901
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4902
36,"""I have been still too long,"" he said, in a tone that must have",The War of the Worlds,4903
36,"reached the pit, ""and now I must bear my witness.  Woe unto this",The War of the Worlds,4904
36,unfaithful city!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe! To the inhabitants of,The War of the Worlds,4905
36,"the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet----""",The War of the Worlds,4906
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4907
36,"""Shut up!"" I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the",The War of the Worlds,4908
36,"Martians should hear us.  ""For God's sake----""",The War of the Worlds,4909
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4910
36,"""Nay,"" shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing",The War of the Worlds,4911
36,"likewise and extending his arms.  ""Speak!  The word of the Lord is",The War of the Worlds,4912
36,"upon me!""",The War of the Worlds,4913
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4914
36,In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.,The War of the Worlds,4915
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4916
36,"""I must bear my witness!  I go!  It has already been too long",The War of the Worlds,4917
36,"delayed.""",The War of the Worlds,4918
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4919
36,I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall.,The War of the Worlds,4920
36,In a flash I was after him.  I was fierce with fear.  Before he was,The War of the Worlds,4921
36,halfway across the kitchen I had overtaken him.  With one last touch,The War of the Worlds,4922
36,of humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt.  He,The War of the Worlds,4923
36,went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground.  I stumbled,The War of the Worlds,4924
36,over him and stood panting.  He lay still.,The War of the Worlds,4925
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4926
36,"Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping",The War of the Worlds,4927
36,"plaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened.  I",The War of the Worlds,4928
36,looked up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming,The War of the Worlds,4929
36,slowly across the hole.  One of its gripping limbs curled amid the,The War of the Worlds,4930
36,"debris; another limb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams.",The War of the Worlds,4931
36,"I stood petrified, staring.  Then I saw through a sort of glass plate",The War of the Worlds,4932
36,"near the edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large",The War of the Worlds,4933
36,"dark eyes of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of",The War of the Worlds,4934
36,tentacle came feeling slowly through the hole.,The War of the Worlds,4935
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4936
36,"I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the",The War of the Worlds,4937
36,"scullery door.  The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in",The War of the Worlds,4938
36,"the room, and twisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, this",The War of the Worlds,4939
36,"way and that.  For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful",The War of the Worlds,4940
36,"advance.  Then, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the",The War of the Worlds,4941
36,scullery.  I trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright.  I,The War of the Worlds,4942
36,"opened the door of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness",The War of the Worlds,4943
36,"staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening.",The War of the Worlds,4944
36,Had the Martian seen me?  What was it doing now?,The War of the Worlds,4945
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4946
36,"Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and",The War of the Worlds,4947
36,"then it tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a",The War of the Worlds,4948
36,"faint metallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring.",The War of the Worlds,4949
36,Then a heavy body--I knew too well what--was dragged across the floor,The War of the Worlds,4950
36,"of the kitchen towards the opening.  Irresistibly attracted, I crept",The War of the Worlds,4951
36,to the door and peeped into the kitchen.  In the triangle of bright,The War of the Worlds,4952
36,"outer sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,",The War of the Worlds,4953
36,scrutinizing the curate's head.  I thought at once that it would infer,The War of the Worlds,4954
36,my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him.,The War of the Worlds,4955
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4956
36,"I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover",The War of the Worlds,4957
36,"myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the",The War of the Worlds,4958
36,"darkness, among the firewood and coal therein.  Every now and then I",The War of the Worlds,4959
36,"paused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through",The War of the Worlds,4960
36,the opening again.,The War of the Worlds,4961
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4962
36,Then the faint metallic jingle returned.  I traced it slowly,The War of the Worlds,4963
36,feeling over the kitchen.  Presently I heard it nearer--in the,The War of the Worlds,4964
36,"scullery, as I judged.  I thought that its length might be",The War of the Worlds,4965
36,"insufficient to reach me.  I prayed copiously.  It passed, scraping",The War of the Worlds,4966
36,faintly across the cellar door.  An age of almost intolerable suspense,The War of the Worlds,4967
36,intervened; then I heard it fumbling at the latch! It had found the,The War of the Worlds,4968
36,door!  The Martians understood doors!,The War of the Worlds,4969
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4970
36,"It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door",The War of the Worlds,4971
36,opened.,The War of the Worlds,4972
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4973
36,In the darkness I could just see the thing--like an elephant's,The War of the Worlds,4974
36,trunk more than anything else--waving towards me and touching and,The War of the Worlds,4975
36,"examining the wall, coals, wood and ceiling.  It was like a black worm",The War of the Worlds,4976
36,swaying its blind head to and fro.,The War of the Worlds,4977
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4978
36,"Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot.  I was on the verge of",The War of the Worlds,4979
36,screaming; I bit my hand.  For a time the tentacle was silent.  I,The War of the Worlds,4980
36,"could have fancied it had been withdrawn.  Presently, with an abrupt",The War of the Worlds,4981
36,"click, it gripped something--I thought it had me!--and seemed to go",The War of the Worlds,4982
36,out of the cellar again.  For a minute I was not sure.  Apparently it,The War of the Worlds,4983
36,had taken a lump of coal to examine.,The War of the Worlds,4984
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4985
36,"I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, which",The War of the Worlds,4986
36,"had become cramped, and then listened.  I whispered passionate prayers",The War of the Worlds,4987
36,for safety.,The War of the Worlds,4988
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4989
36,"Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again.",The War of the Worlds,4990
36,"Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping",The War of the Worlds,4991
36,the furniture.,The War of the Worlds,4992
36,"",The War of the Worlds,4993
36,"While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar",The War of the Worlds,4994
36,"door and closed it.  I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins",The War of the Worlds,4995
36,"rattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against",The War of the Worlds,4996
36,the cellar door.  Then silence that passed into an infinity of,The War of the Worlds,4997
36,suspense.,The War of the Worlds,4998

36,Had it gone?,The War of the Worlds,5000

36,At last I decided that it had.,The War of the Worlds,5002

36,"the close darkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring even",The War of the Worlds,5005
36,to crawl out for the drink for which I craved.  It was the eleventh day,The War of the Worlds,5006

36,"scrap of food had gone.  Apparently, the Martian had taken it all on",The War of the Worlds,5018
36,the previous day.  At that discovery I despaired for the first time.  I,The War of the Worlds,5019
36,"took no food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day.",The War of the Worlds,5020
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5021
36,"At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed",The War of the Worlds,5022
36,"sensibly.  I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of",The War of the Worlds,5023
36,despondent wretchedness.  My mind ran on eating.  I thought I had,The War of the Worlds,5024
36,"become deaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear",The War of the Worlds,5025
36,from the pit had ceased absolutely.  I did not feel strong enough to,The War of the Worlds,5026
36,"crawl noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.",The War of the Worlds,5027
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5028
36,"On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance",The War of the Worlds,5029
36,"of alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that",The War of the Worlds,5030
36,"stood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and",The War of the Worlds,5031
36,"tainted rain water.  I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened",The War of the Worlds,5032
36,by the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my,The War of the Worlds,5033
36,pumping.,The War of the Worlds,5034
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5035
36,"During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much",The War of the Worlds,5036
36,of the curate and of the manner of his death.,The War of the Worlds,5037
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5038
36,"On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and",The War of the Worlds,5039
36,thought disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of,The War of the Worlds,5040
36,"escape.  Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death",The War of the Worlds,5041
36,"of the curate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a",The War of the Worlds,5042
36,keen pain that urged me to drink again and again.  The light that came,The War of the Worlds,5043
36,"into the scullery was no longer grey, but red.  To my disordered",The War of the Worlds,5044
36,imagination it seemed the colour of blood.,The War of the Worlds,5045
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5046
36,"On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised",The War of the Worlds,5047
36,to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across,The War of the Worlds,5048
36,"the hole in the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a",The War of the Worlds,5049
36,crimson-coloured obscurity.,The War of the Worlds,5050
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5051
36,"It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiar",The War of the Worlds,5052
36,"sequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as",The War of the Worlds,5053
36,"the snuffing and scratching of a dog.  Going into the kitchen, I saw a",The War of the Worlds,5054
36,dog's nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds.  This,The War of the Worlds,5055
36,greatly surprised me.  At the scent of me he barked shortly.,The War of the Worlds,5056
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5057
36,I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I,The War of the Worlds,5058
36,"should be able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it",The War of the Worlds,5059
36,"would be advisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted the",The War of the Worlds,5060
36,attention of the Martians.,The War of the Worlds,5061
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5062
36,"I crept forward, saying ""Good dog!"" very softly; but he suddenly",The War of the Worlds,5063
36,withdrew his head and disappeared.,The War of the Worlds,5064
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5065
36,I listened--I was not deaf--but certainly the pit was still.  I,The War of the Worlds,5066
36,"heard a sound like the flutter of a bird's wings, and a hoarse",The War of the Worlds,5067
36,"croaking, but that was all.",The War of the Worlds,5068
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5069
36,"For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to",The War of the Worlds,5070
36,move aside the red plants that obscured it.  Once or twice I heard a,The War of the Worlds,5071
36,faint pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither,The War of the Worlds,5072
36,"on the sand far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds, but",The War of the Worlds,5073
36,"that was all.  At length, encouraged by the silence, I looked out.",The War of the Worlds,5074
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5075
36,"Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought",The War of the Worlds,5076
36,"over the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there was",The War of the Worlds,5077
36,not a living thing in the pit.,The War of the Worlds,5078
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5079
36,"I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes.  All the machinery",The War of the Worlds,5080
36,had gone.  Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one,The War of the Worlds,5081
36,"corner, certain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and the",The War of the Worlds,5082
36,"skeletons of the killed, the place was merely an empty circular pit in",The War of the Worlds,5083
36,the sand.,The War of the Worlds,5084
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5085
36,"Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the",The War of the Worlds,5086
36,"mound of rubble.  I could see in any direction save behind me, to the",The War of the Worlds,5087
36,"north, and neither Martians nor sign of Martians were to be seen.  The",The War of the Worlds,5088
36,"pit dropped sheerly from my feet, but a little way along the rubbish",The War of the Worlds,5089
36,afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins.  My chance of,The War of the Worlds,5090
36,escape had come.  I began to tremble.,The War of the Worlds,5091
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5092
36,"I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate",The War of the Worlds,5093
36,"resolution, and with a heart that throbbed violently, I scrambled to",The War of the Worlds,5094
36,the top of the mound in which I had been buried so long.,The War of the Worlds,5095
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5096
36,"I looked about again.  To the northward, too, no Martian was",The War of the Worlds,5097
36,visible.,The War of the Worlds,5098
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5099
36,When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been,The War of the Worlds,5100
36,"a straggling street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed",The War of the Worlds,5101
36,with abundant shady trees.  Now I stood on a mound of smashed,The War of the Worlds,5102
36,"brickwork, clay, and gravel, over which spread a multitude of red",The War of the Worlds,5103
36,"cactus-shaped plants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth",The War of the Worlds,5104
36,"to dispute their footing.  The trees near me were dead and brown, but",The War of the Worlds,5105
36,further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems.,The War of the Worlds,5106
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5107
36,"The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had been",The War of the Worlds,5108
36,"burned; their walls stood, sometimes to the second story, with smashed",The War of the Worlds,5109
36,windows and shattered doors.  The red weed grew tumultuously in their,The War of the Worlds,5110
36,"roofless rooms.  Below me was the great pit, with the crows struggling",The War of the Worlds,5111
36,for its refuse.  A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins.,The War of the Worlds,5112
36,"Far away I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but traces",The War of the Worlds,5113
36,of men there were none.,The War of the Worlds,5114
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5115
36,"The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement, dazzlingly",The War of the Worlds,5116
36,"bright, the sky a glowing blue.  A gentle breeze kept the red weed",The War of the Worlds,5117
36,that covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying.  And oh!,The War of the Worlds,5118
36,the sweetness of the air!,The War of the Worlds,5119

36,"",The War of the Worlds,5124
36,THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS,The War of the Worlds,5125
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5126
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5127
36,For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my,The War of the Worlds,5128
36,safety.  Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had,The War of the Worlds,5129
36,thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security.  I had,The War of the Worlds,5130
36,"not realised what had been happening to the world, had not anticipated",The War of the Worlds,5131
36,this startling vision of unfamiliar things.  I had expected to see,The War of the Worlds,5132
36,"Sheen in ruins--I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, of",The War of the Worlds,5133
36,another planet.,The War of the Worlds,5134
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5135
36,For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of,The War of the Worlds,5136
36,"men, yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well.  I",The War of the Worlds,5137
36,felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly,The War of the Worlds,5138
36,confronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations,The War of the Worlds,5139
36,of a house.  I felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew,The War of the Worlds,5140
36,"quite clear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of",The War of the Worlds,5141
36,"dethronement, a persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an",The War of the Worlds,5142
36,"animal among the animals, under the Martian heel.  With us it would be",The War of the Worlds,5143
36,"as with them, to lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire",The War of the Worlds,5144
36,of man had passed away.,The War of the Worlds,5145
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5146
36,"But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my",The War of the Worlds,5147
36,dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast.  In the,The War of the Worlds,5148
36,"direction away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch",The War of the Worlds,5149
36,"of garden ground unburied.  This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,",The War of the Worlds,5150
36,"and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed.  The density of the",The War of the Worlds,5151
36,weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding.  The wall was some six feet,The War of the Worlds,5152
36,"high, and when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my",The War of the Worlds,5153
36,"feet to the crest.  So I went along by the side of it, and came to a",The War of the Worlds,5154
36,"corner and a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble",The War of the Worlds,5155
36,"into the garden I coveted.  Here I found some young onions, a couple",The War of the Worlds,5156
36,"of gladiolus bulbs, and a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I",The War of the Worlds,5157
36,"secured, and, scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through",The War of the Worlds,5158
36,scarlet and crimson trees towards Kew--it was like walking through an,The War of the Worlds,5159
36,avenue of gigantic blood drops--possessed with two ideas: to get more,The War of the Worlds,5160
36,"food, and to limp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out of",The War of the Worlds,5161
36,this accursed unearthly region of the pit.,The War of the Worlds,5162
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5163
36,"Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which",The War of the Worlds,5164
36,"also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow",The War of the Worlds,5165
36,"water, where meadows used to be.  These fragments of nourishment served",The War of the Worlds,5166
36,only to whet my hunger.  At first I was surprised at this flood in a,The War of the Worlds,5167
36,"hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the",The War of the Worlds,5168
36,tropical exuberance of the red weed.  Directly this extraordinary,The War of the Worlds,5169
36,growth encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of,The War of the Worlds,5170
36,unparalleled fecundity.  Its seeds were simply poured down into the,The War of the Worlds,5171
36,"water of the Wey and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic water",The War of the Worlds,5172
36,fronds speedily choked both those rivers.,The War of the Worlds,5173
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5174
36,"At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a",The War of the Worlds,5175
36,"tangle of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in",The War of the Worlds,5176
36,a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and,The War of the Worlds,5177
36,"Twickenham.  As the water spread the weed followed them, until the",The War of the Worlds,5178
36,ruined villas of the Thames valley were for a time lost in this red,The War of the Worlds,5179
36,"swamp, whose margin I explored, and much of the desolation the",The War of the Worlds,5180
36,Martians had caused was concealed.,The War of the Worlds,5181
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5182
36,In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had,The War of the Worlds,5183
36,"spread.  A cankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of",The War of the Worlds,5184
36,"certain bacteria, presently seized upon it.  Now by the action of",The War of the Worlds,5185
36,"natural selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting",The War of the Worlds,5186
36,power against bacterial diseases--they never succumb without a severe,The War of the Worlds,5187
36,"struggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead.  The",The War of the Worlds,5188
36,"fronds became bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle.  They broke",The War of the Worlds,5189
36,"off at the least touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early",The War of the Worlds,5190
36,growth carried their last vestiges out to sea.,The War of the Worlds,5191
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5192
36,"My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my",The War of the Worlds,5193
36,"thirst.  I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed",The War of the Worlds,5194
36,"some fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly,",The War of the Worlds,5195
36,metallic taste.  I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to,The War of the Worlds,5196
36,"wade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the",The War of the Worlds,5197
36,"flood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to",The War of the Worlds,5198
36,Mortlake.  I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins,The War of the Worlds,5199
36,"of its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of this",The War of the Worlds,5200
36,spate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came,The War of the Worlds,5201
36,out on Putney Common.,The War of the Worlds,5202
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5203
36,Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the,The War of the Worlds,5204
36,wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation,The War of the Worlds,5205
36,"of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly",The War of the Worlds,5206
36,"undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors",The War of the Worlds,5207
36,"closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if",The War of the Worlds,5208
36,their inhabitants slept within.  The red weed was less abundant; the,The War of the Worlds,5209
36,tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper.  I hunted,The War of the Worlds,5210
36,"for food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple",The War of the Worlds,5211
36,"of silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked.",The War of the Worlds,5212
36,"I rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in",The War of the Worlds,5213
36,"my enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on.",The War of the Worlds,5214
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5215
36,"All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians.",The War of the Worlds,5216
36,"I encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried",The War of the Worlds,5217
36,circuitously away from the advances I made them.  Near Roehampton I,The War of the Worlds,5218
36,"had seen two human skeletons--not bodies, but skeletons, picked",The War of the Worlds,5219
36,clean--and in the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones,The War of the Worlds,5220
36,of several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep.  But though I,The War of the Worlds,5221
36,"gnawed parts of these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from",The War of the Worlds,5222
36,them.,The War of the Worlds,5223
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5224
36,"After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I",The War of the Worlds,5225
36,think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason.  And in the,The War of the Worlds,5226
36,"garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,",The War of the Worlds,5227
36,sufficient to stay my hunger.  From this garden one looked down upon,The War of the Worlds,5228
36,Putney and the river.  The aspect of the place in the dusk was,The War of the Worlds,5229
36,"singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and",The War of the Worlds,5230
36,"down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the",The War of the Worlds,5231
36,weed.  And over all--silence.  It filled me with indescribable terror,The War of the Worlds,5232
36,to think how swiftly that desolating change had come.,The War of the Worlds,5233
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5234
36,"For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence,",The War of the Worlds,5235
36,"and that I stood there alone, the last man left alive.  Hard by the",The War of the Worlds,5236
36,"top of Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms",The War of the Worlds,5237
36,dislocated and removed several yards from the rest of the body.  As I,The War of the Worlds,5238
36,proceeded I became more and more convinced that the extermination of,The War of the Worlds,5239
36,"mankind was, save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished",The War of the Worlds,5240
36,"in this part of the world.  The Martians, I thought, had gone on and",The War of the Worlds,5241
36,"left the country desolated, seeking food elsewhere.  Perhaps even now",The War of the Worlds,5242
36,"they were destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone",The War of the Worlds,5243

36,THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL,The War of the Worlds,5250
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5251
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5252
36,I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney,The War of the Worlds,5253
36,"Hill, sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to",The War of the Worlds,5254
36,Leatherhead.  I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into,The War of the Worlds,5255
36,that house--afterwards I found the front door was on the latch--nor,The War of the Worlds,5256
36,"how I ransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of",The War of the Worlds,5257
36,"despair, in what seemed to me to be a servant's bedroom, I found a",The War of the Worlds,5258
36,rat-gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple.  The place had been,The War of the Worlds,5259
36,already searched and emptied.  In the bar I afterwards found some,The War of the Worlds,5260
36,biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked.  The latter I could,The War of the Worlds,5261
36,"not eat, they were too rotten, but the former not only stayed my",The War of the Worlds,5262
36,"hunger, but filled my pockets.  I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian",The War of the Worlds,5263
36,might come beating that part of London for food in the night.  Before,The War of the Worlds,5264
36,"I went to bed I had an interval of restlessness, and prowled from",The War of the Worlds,5265
36,"window to window, peering out for some sign of these monsters.  I",The War of the Worlds,5266
36,slept little.  As I lay in bed I found myself thinking consecutively--a,The War of the Worlds,5267
36,thing I do not remember to have done since my last argument with the,The War of the Worlds,5268
36,curate.  During all the intervening time my mental condition had been,The War of the Worlds,5269
36,a hurrying succession of vague emotional states or a sort of stupid,The War of the Worlds,5270
36,"receptivity.  But in the night my brain, reinforced, I suppose, by the",The War of the Worlds,5271
36,"food I had eaten, grew clear again, and I thought.",The War of the Worlds,5272
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5273
36,Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of,The War of the Worlds,5274
36,"the curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of",The War of the Worlds,5275
36,my wife.  The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to,The War of the Worlds,5276
36,"recall; I saw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely",The War of the Worlds,5277
36,disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse.  I saw myself,The War of the Worlds,5278
36,"then as I see myself now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow,",The War of the Worlds,5279
36,the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that.  I,The War of the Worlds,5280
36,"felt no condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted",The War of the Worlds,5281
36,"me.  In the silence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of",The War of the Worlds,5282
36,"God that sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood",The War of the Worlds,5283
36,"my trial, my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear.  I",The War of the Worlds,5284
36,retraced every step of our conversation from the moment when I had,The War of the Worlds,5285
36,"found him crouching beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to",The War of the Worlds,5286
36,the fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge.  We,The War of the Worlds,5287
36,had been incapable of co-operation--grim chance had taken no heed of,The War of the Worlds,5288
36,"that.  Had I foreseen, I should have left him at Halliford.  But I did",The War of the Worlds,5289
36,not foresee; and crime is to foresee and do.  And I set this down as I,The War of the Worlds,5290
36,"have set all this story down, as it was.  There were no witnesses--all",The War of the Worlds,5291
36,"these things I might have concealed.  But I set it down, and the",The War of the Worlds,5292
36,reader must form his judgment as he will.,The War of the Worlds,5293
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5294
36,"And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate",The War of the Worlds,5295
36,"body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife.  For",The War of the Worlds,5296
36,"the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,",The War of the Worlds,5297
36,"unhappily, I could for the latter.  And suddenly that night became",The War of the Worlds,5298
36,"terrible.  I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark.  I",The War of the Worlds,5299
36,found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and,The War of the Worlds,5300
36,painlessly struck her out of being.  Since the night of my return from,The War of the Worlds,5301
36,"Leatherhead I had not prayed.  I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,",The War of the Worlds,5302
36,had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now,The War of the Worlds,5303
36,"I prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with",The War of the Worlds,5304
36,"the darkness of God.  Strange night!  Strangest in this, that so soon",The War of the Worlds,5305
36,"as dawn had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house",The War of the Worlds,5306
36,"like a rat leaving its hiding place--a creature scarcely larger, an",The War of the Worlds,5307
36,"inferior animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters",The War of the Worlds,5308
36,might be hunted and killed.  Perhaps they also prayed confidently to,The War of the Worlds,5309
36,"God.  Surely, if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us",The War of the Worlds,5310
36,pity--pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion.,The War of the Worlds,5311
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5312
36,"The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink,",The War of the Worlds,5313
36,and was fretted with little golden clouds.  In the road that runs from,The War of the Worlds,5314
36,the top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of,The War of the Worlds,5315
36,the panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night,The War of the Worlds,5316
36,after the fighting began.  There was a little two-wheeled cart,The War of the Worlds,5317
36,"inscribed with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with",The War of the Worlds,5318
36,a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat,The War of the Worlds,5319
36,"trampled into the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot",The War of the Worlds,5320
36,of blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough.  My,The War of the Worlds,5321
36,"movements were languid, my plans of the vaguest.  I had an idea of",The War of the Worlds,5322
36,"going to Leatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest",The War of the Worlds,5323
36,"chance of finding my wife.  Certainly, unless death had overtaken them",The War of the Worlds,5324
36,"suddenly, my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to",The War of the Worlds,5325
36,me I might find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled.  I,The War of the Worlds,5326
36,"knew I wanted to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the",The War of the Worlds,5327
36,"world of men, but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done.  I",The War of the Worlds,5328
36,was also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness.  From the corner,The War of the Worlds,5329
36,"I went, under cover of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of",The War of the Worlds,5330
36,"Wimbledon Common, stretching wide and far.",The War of the Worlds,5331
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5332
36,That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom;,The War of the Worlds,5333
36,"there was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the",The War of the Worlds,5334
36,"verge of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and",The War of the Worlds,5335
36,vitality.  I came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place,The War of the Worlds,5336
36,"among the trees.  I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from",The War of the Worlds,5337
36,"their stout resolve to live.  And presently, turning suddenly, with an",The War of the Worlds,5338
36,"odd feeling of being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a",The War of the Worlds,5339
36,"clump of bushes.  I stood regarding this.  I made a step towards it,",The War of the Worlds,5340
36,and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass.  I approached,The War of the Worlds,5341
36,"him slowly.  He stood silent and motionless, regarding me.",The War of the Worlds,5342
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5343
36,As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and,The War of the Worlds,5344
36,"filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged",The War of the Worlds,5345
36,"through a culvert.  Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches",The War of the Worlds,5346
36,"mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches.  His",The War of the Worlds,5347
36,"black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and",The War of the Worlds,5348
36,"sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him.  There was a red cut",The War of the Worlds,5349
36,across the lower part of his face.,The War of the Worlds,5350
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5351
36,"""Stop!"" he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I",The War of the Worlds,5352
36,"stopped.  His voice was hoarse.  ""Where do you come from?"" he said.",The War of the Worlds,5353
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5354
36,"I thought, surveying him.",The War of the Worlds,5355
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5356
36,"""I come from Mortlake,"" I said.  ""I was buried near the pit the",The War of the Worlds,5357

36,"",The War of the Worlds,5364
36,I answered slowly.,The War of the Worlds,5365
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5366
36,"""I don't know,"" I said.  ""I have been buried in the ruins of a",The War of the Worlds,5367

36,"",The War of the Worlds,5369

36,expression.,The War of the Worlds,5371
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5372
36,"""I've no wish to stop about here,"" said I.  ""I think I shall go to",The War of the Worlds,5373

36,"""It is you,"" said he; ""the man from Woking.  And you weren't killed",The War of the Worlds,5378
36,"at Weybridge?""",The War of the Worlds,5379
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5380
36,I recognised him at the same moment.,The War of the Worlds,5381

36,"""You are the artilleryman who came into my garden.""",The War of the Worlds,5383
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5384
36,"""Good luck!"" he said.  ""We are lucky ones!  Fancy _you_!""  He put out",The War of the Worlds,5385
36,"a hand, and I took it.  ""I crawled up a drain,"" he said. ""But they",The War of the Worlds,5386
36,didn't kill everyone.  And after they went away I got off towards,The War of the Worlds,5387
36,Walton across the fields.  But---- It's not sixteen days altogether--and,The War of the Worlds,5388
36,"your hair is grey.""  He looked over his shoulder suddenly.  ""Only",The War of the Worlds,5389
36,"a rook,"" he said.  ""One gets to know that birds have shadows these",The War of the Worlds,5390

36,"",The War of the Worlds,5392
36,"""Have you seen any Martians?"" I said.  ""Since I crawled out----""",The War of the Worlds,5393
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5394
36,"""They've gone away across London,"" he said.  ""I guess they've got a",The War of the Worlds,5395
36,"bigger camp there.  Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the sky",The War of the Worlds,5396
36,"is alive with their lights.  It's like a great city, and in the glare",The War of the Worlds,5397
36,you can just see them moving.  By daylight you can't.  But nearer--I,The War of the Worlds,5398
36,"haven't seen them--"" (he counted on his fingers) ""five days.  Then I",The War of the Worlds,5399

36,"",The War of the Worlds,5404

36,"",The War of the Worlds,5421
36,"I stared.  Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact--a",The War of the Worlds,5422
36,fact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke.  I had still held a,The War of the Worlds,5423
36,"vague hope; rather, I had kept a lifelong habit of mind.  He repeated",The War of the Worlds,5424

36,"They'll get it right again.  And even if there's a delay, how can it",The War of the Worlds,5448

36,thinking.  After Weybridge I went south--thinking.  I saw what was up.,The War of the Worlds,5463
36,Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves.,The War of the Worlds,5464

36,"see, or just how you'd been buried.  All these--the sort of people",The War of the Worlds,5558
36,"that lived in these houses, and all those damn little clerks that used",The War of the Worlds,5559
36,to live down that way--they'd be no good.  They haven't any spirit in,The War of the Worlds,5560
36,them--no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn't one or,The War of the Worlds,5561
36,the other--Lord!  What is he but funk and precautions?  They just used,The War of the Worlds,5562
36,"to skedaddle off to work--I've seen hundreds of 'em, bit of breakfast",The War of the Worlds,5563
36,"in hand, running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket",The War of the Worlds,5564
36,"train, for fear they'd get dismissed if they didn't; working at",The War of the Worlds,5565
36,businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand;,The War of the Worlds,5566
36,skedaddling back for fear they wouldn't be in time for dinner; keeping,The War of the Worlds,5567
36,"indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets, and sleeping with",The War of the Worlds,5568
36,"the wives they married, not because they wanted them, but because they",The War of the Worlds,5569
36,had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little,The War of the Worlds,5570
36,miserable skedaddle through the world.  Lives insured and a bit,The War of the Worlds,5571
36,invested for fear of accidents.  And on Sundays--fear of the,The War of the Worlds,5572
36,"hereafter.  As if hell was built for rabbits!  Well, the Martians will",The War of the Worlds,5573
36,"just be a godsend to these.  Nice roomy cages, fattening food, careful",The War of the Worlds,5574
36,"breeding, no worry.  After a week or so chasing about the fields and",The War of the Worlds,5575
36,"lands on empty stomachs, they'll come and be caught cheerful.  They'll",The War of the Worlds,5576
36,be quite glad after a bit.  They'll wonder what people did before,The War of the Worlds,5577
36,"there were Martians to take care of them.  And the bar loafers, and",The War of the Worlds,5578
36,"mashers, and singers--I can imagine them.  I can imagine them,"" he",The War of the Worlds,5579
36,"said, with a sort of sombre gratification.  ""There'll be any amount of",The War of the Worlds,5580
36,sentiment and religion loose among them.  There's hundreds of things I,The War of the Worlds,5581
36,saw with my eyes that I've only begun to see clearly these last few,The War of the Worlds,5582
36,days.  There's lots will take things as they are--fat and stupid; and,The War of the Worlds,5583
36,"lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it's all wrong, and",The War of the Worlds,5584
36,that they ought to be doing something.  Now whenever things are so,The War of the Worlds,5585
36,"that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something, the weak,",The War of the Worlds,5586
36,"and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always make",The War of the Worlds,5587
36,"for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and",The War of the Worlds,5588
36,submit to persecution and the will of the Lord.  Very likely you've,The War of the Worlds,5589
36,"seen the same thing.  It's energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean",The War of the Worlds,5590
36,inside out.  These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety.,The War of the Worlds,5591

36,"",The War of the Worlds,5612

36,against this man's reasoning.  In the days before the invasion no one,The War of the Worlds,5614
36,"would have questioned my intellectual superiority to his--I, a",The War of the Worlds,5615
36,"professed and recognised writer on philosophical themes, and he, a",The War of the Worlds,5616
36,common soldier; and yet he had already formulated a situation that I,The War of the Worlds,5617
36,had scarcely realised.,The War of the Worlds,5618
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5619
36,"""What are you doing?"" I said presently.  ""What plans have you",The War of the Worlds,5620
36,"made?""",The War of the Worlds,5621

36,He hesitated.,The War of the Worlds,5623
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5624
36,"""Well, it's like this,"" he said.  ""What have we to do?  We have to",The War of the Worlds,5625
36,"invent a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be",The War of the Worlds,5626
36,"sufficiently secure to bring the children up.  Yes--wait a bit, and",The War of the Worlds,5627
36,I'll make it clearer what I think ought to be done.  The tame ones,The War of the Worlds,5628
36,"will go like all tame beasts; in a few generations they'll be big,",The War of the Worlds,5629
36,"beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid--rubbish! The risk is that we who keep",The War of the Worlds,5630
36,"wild will go savage--degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . .",The War of the Worlds,5631
36,"You see, how I mean to live is underground.  I've been thinking about",The War of the Worlds,5632

36,things; but under this London are miles and miles--hundreds of,The War of the Worlds,5634

36,"begin to see?  And we form a band--able-bodied, clean-minded men.",The War of the Worlds,5639

36,and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die.  They,The War of the Worlds,5652
36,ought to die.  They ought to be willing to die.  It's a sort of,The War of the Worlds,5653
36,"disloyalty, after all, to live and taint the race.  And they can't be",The War of the Worlds,5654
36,"happy.  Moreover, dying's none so dreadful; it's the funking makes it",The War of the Worlds,5655
36,bad.  And in all those places we shall gather.  Our district will be,The War of the Worlds,5656

36,"perhaps I will.  Get caught, I mean.  And the great thing is, we must",The War of the Worlds,5668
36,leave the Martians alone.  We mustn't even steal.  If we get in their,The War of the Worlds,5669

36,"",The War of the Worlds,5689

36,"tone of assurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated my",The War of the Worlds,5691
36,mind.  I believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny,The War of the Worlds,5692
36,"and in the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader",The War of the Worlds,5693
36,"who thinks me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position,",The War of the Worlds,5694
36,"reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine,",The War of the Worlds,5695
36,"crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening, distracted by",The War of the Worlds,5696
36,apprehension.  We talked in this manner through the early morning,The War of the Worlds,5697
36,"time, and later crept out of the bushes, and, after scanning the sky",The War of the Worlds,5698
36,"for Martians, hurried precipitately to the house on Putney Hill where",The War of the Worlds,5699
36,"he had made his lair.  It was the coal cellar of the place, and when I",The War of the Worlds,5700
36,saw the work he had spent a week upon--it was a burrow scarcely ten,The War of the Worlds,5701
36,"yards long, which he designed to reach to the main drain on Putney",The War of the Worlds,5702
36,Hill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his,The War of the Worlds,5703
36,powers.  Such a hole I could have dug in a day.  But I believed in him,The War of the Worlds,5704
36,sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at,The War of the Worlds,5705
36,his digging.  We had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed,The War of the Worlds,5706
36,against the kitchen range.  We refreshed ourselves with a tin of,The War of the Worlds,5707
36,mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry.  I found a,The War of the Worlds,5708
36,curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady,The War of the Worlds,5709
36,"labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in my mind, and",The War of the Worlds,5710
36,presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I worked there all,The War of the Worlds,5711
36,"the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a purpose again.  After",The War of the Worlds,5712
36,working an hour I began to speculate on the distance one had to go,The War of the Worlds,5713
36,"before the cloaca was reached, the chances we had of missing it",The War of the Worlds,5714
36,altogether.  My immediate trouble was why we should dig this long,The War of the Worlds,5715
36,"tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of",The War of the Worlds,5716
36,"the manholes, and work back to the house.  It seemed to me, too, that",The War of the Worlds,5717
36,"the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless length of",The War of the Worlds,5718
36,"tunnel.  And just as I was beginning to face these things, the",The War of the Worlds,5719
36,"artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me.",The War of the Worlds,5720
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5721
36,"""We're working well,"" he said.  He put down his spade. ""Let us",The War of the Worlds,5722

36,and looking down at them.  Heaven knows how long he had been there.,The War of the Worlds,5768
36,It must have given some of them a nasty turn.  He came down the road,The War of the Worlds,5769

36,After a time we went down to the cellar.  Neither of us seemed,The War of the Worlds,5784

36,"nothing loath.  He became suddenly very generous, and when we had",The War of the Worlds,5786
36,eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars.  We lit,The War of the Worlds,5787

36,lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the,The War of the Worlds,5822
36,Highgate hills.,The War of the Worlds,5823
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5824
36,At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley.  The,The War of the Worlds,5825
36,northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington,The War of the Worlds,5826
36,"glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed",The War of the Worlds,5827
36,up and vanished in the deep blue night.  All the rest of London,The War of the Worlds,5828
36,"was black.  Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale,",The War of the Worlds,5829
36,"violet-purple fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze.  For",The War of the Worlds,5830
36,"a space I could not understand it, and then I knew that it must be",The War of the Worlds,5831
36,the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded.  With that,The War of the Worlds,5832
36,"realisation my dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion of",The War of the Worlds,5833
36,"things, awoke again.  I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear,",The War of the Worlds,5834
36,"glowing high in the west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the",The War of the Worlds,5835
36,darkness of Hampstead and Highgate.,The War of the Worlds,5836
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5837
36,"I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the",The War of the Worlds,5838
36,grotesque changes of the day.  I recalled my mental states from the,The War of the Worlds,5839
36,midnight prayer to the foolish card-playing.  I had a violent,The War of the Worlds,5840
36,revulsion of feeling.  I remember I flung away the cigar with a,The War of the Worlds,5841
36,certain wasteful symbolism.  My folly came to me with glaring,The War of the Worlds,5842
36,exaggeration.  I seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was,The War of the Worlds,5843
36,filled with remorse.  I resolved to leave this strange undisciplined,The War of the Worlds,5844
36,"dreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony, and to go on into",The War of the Worlds,5845
36,"London.  There, it seemed to me, I had the best chance of learning",The War of the Worlds,5846
36,what the Martians and my fellowmen were doing.  I was still upon the,The War of the Worlds,5847
36,roof when the late moon rose.,The War of the Worlds,5848

36,"After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and",The War of the Worlds,5857
36,by the High Street across the bridge to Fulham.  The red weed was,The War of the Worlds,5858
36,"tumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its",The War of the Worlds,5859
36,fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that,The War of the Worlds,5860
36,presently removed it so swiftly.,The War of the Worlds,5861
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5862
36,At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I,The War of the Worlds,5863
36,"found a man lying.  He was as black as a sweep with the black dust,",The War of the Worlds,5864
36,"alive, but helplessly and speechlessly drunk.  I could get nothing",The War of the Worlds,5865
36,from him but curses and furious lunges at my head.  I think I should,The War of the Worlds,5866
36,have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face.,The War of the Worlds,5867
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5868
36,"There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and",The War of the Worlds,5869
36,it grew thicker in Fulham.  The streets were horribly quiet.  I got,The War of the Worlds,5870
36,"food--sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable--in a baker's shop",The War of the Worlds,5871
36,here.  Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of,The War of the Worlds,5872
36,"powder, and I passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of",The War of the Worlds,5873
36,"the burning was an absolute relief.  Going on towards Brompton, the",The War of the Worlds,5874
36,streets were quiet again.,The War of the Worlds,5875
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5876
36,Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon,The War of the Worlds,5877
36,dead bodies.  I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the,The War of the Worlds,5878
36,"Fulham Road.  They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly",The War of the Worlds,5879
36,"past them.  The black powder covered them over, and softened their",The War of the Worlds,5880
36,outlines.  One or two had been disturbed by dogs.,The War of the Worlds,5881
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5882
36,"Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in",The War of the Worlds,5883
36,"the City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds",The War of the Worlds,5884
36,"drawn, the desertion, and the stillness.  In some places plunderers",The War of the Worlds,5885
36,"had been at work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine",The War of the Worlds,5886
36,"shops.  A jeweller's window had been broken open in one place, but",The War of the Worlds,5887
36,"apparently the thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains",The War of the Worlds,5888
36,and a watch lay scattered on the pavement.  I did not trouble to touch,The War of the Worlds,5889
36,them.  Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the,The War of the Worlds,5890
36,hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown,The War of the Worlds,5891
36,"dress, and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the",The War of the Worlds,5892
36,"pavement.  She seemed asleep, but she was dead.",The War of the Worlds,5893
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5894
36,"The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the",The War of the Worlds,5895
36,stillness.  But it was not so much the stillness of death--it was the,The War of the Worlds,5896
36,"stillness of suspense, of expectation.  At any time the destruction",The War of the Worlds,5897
36,"that had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis,",The War of the Worlds,5898
36,"and had annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these",The War of the Worlds,5899
36,houses and leave them smoking ruins.  It was a city condemned and,The War of the Worlds,5900
36,derelict. . . .,The War of the Worlds,5901
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5902
36,In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black,The War of the Worlds,5903
36,powder.  It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling.,The War of the Worlds,5904
36,It crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses.  It was a sobbing,The War of the Worlds,5905
36,"alternation of two notes, ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" keeping on",The War of the Worlds,5906
36,perpetually.  When I passed streets that ran northward it grew in,The War of the Worlds,5907
36,"volume, and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off",The War of the Worlds,5908
36,"again.  It came in a full tide down Exhibition Road.  I stopped,",The War of the Worlds,5909
36,"staring towards Kensington Gardens, wondering at this strange, remote",The War of the Worlds,5910
36,wailing.  It was as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice,The War of the Worlds,5911
36,for its fear and solitude.,The War of the Worlds,5912
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5913
36,"""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" wailed that superhuman note--great waves",The War of the Worlds,5914
36,"of sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall",The War of the Worlds,5915
36,"buildings on each side.  I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the",The War of the Worlds,5916
36,iron gates of Hyde Park.  I had half a mind to break into the Natural,The War of the Worlds,5917
36,"History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in",The War of the Worlds,5918
36,"order to see across the park.  But I decided to keep to the ground,",The War of the Worlds,5919
36,"where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition",The War of the Worlds,5920
36,Road.  All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and,The War of the Worlds,5921
36,"still, and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses.  At",The War of the Worlds,5922
36,"the top, near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight--a bus",The War of the Worlds,5923
36,"overturned, and the skeleton of a horse picked clean.  I puzzled over",The War of the Worlds,5924
36,"this for a time, and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine.",The War of the Worlds,5925
36,"The voice grew stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above",The War of the Worlds,5926
36,"the housetops on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to",The War of the Worlds,5927
36,the northwest.,The War of the Worlds,5928
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5929
36,"""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to",The War of the Worlds,5930
36,"me, from the district about Regent's Park.  The desolating cry worked",The War of the Worlds,5931
36,upon my mind.  The mood that had sustained me passed.  The wailing,The War of the Worlds,5932
36,"took possession of me.  I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and",The War of the Worlds,5933
36,now again hungry and thirsty.,The War of the Worlds,5934
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5935
36,It was already past noon.  Why was I wandering alone in this city,The War of the Worlds,5936
36,"of the dead?  Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and",The War of the Worlds,5937
36,in its black shroud?  I felt intolerably lonely.  My mind ran on old,The War of the Worlds,5938
36,friends that I had forgotten for years.  I thought of the poisons in,The War of the Worlds,5939
36,"the chemists' shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I",The War of the Worlds,5940
36,"recalled the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew,",The War of the Worlds,5941
36,shared the city with myself. . . .,The War of the Worlds,5942
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5943
36,"I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were",The War of the Worlds,5944
36,"black powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the",The War of the Worlds,5945
36,gratings of the cellars of some of the houses.  I grew very thirsty,The War of the Worlds,5946
36,after the heat of my long walk.  With infinite trouble I managed to,The War of the Worlds,5947
36,break into a public-house and get food and drink.  I was weary after,The War of the Worlds,5948
36,"eating, and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black",The War of the Worlds,5949
36,horsehair sofa I found there.,The War of the Worlds,5950
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5951
36,"I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, ""Ulla, ulla,",The War of the Worlds,5952
36,"ulla, ulla.""  It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some",The War of the Worlds,5953
36,"biscuits and a cheese in the bar--there was a meat safe, but it",The War of the Worlds,5954
36,contained nothing but maggots--I wandered on through the silent,The War of the Worlds,5955
36,residential squares to Baker Street--Portman Square is the only one I,The War of the Worlds,5956
36,can name--and so came out at last upon Regent's Park.  And as I,The War of the Worlds,5957
36,"emerged from the top of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees in",The War of the Worlds,5958
36,the clearness of the sunset the hood of the Martian giant from which,The War of the Worlds,5959
36,this howling proceeded.  I was not terrified.  I came upon him as if,The War of the Worlds,5960
36,"it were a matter of course.  I watched him for some time, but he did",The War of the Worlds,5961
36,"not move.  He appeared to be standing and yelling, for no reason that",The War of the Worlds,5962
36,I could discover.,The War of the Worlds,5963
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5964
36,I tried to formulate a plan of action.  That perpetual sound of,The War of the Worlds,5965
36,"""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" confused my mind.  Perhaps I was too tired",The War of the Worlds,5966
36,to be very fearful.  Certainly I was more curious to know the reason,The War of the Worlds,5967
36,of this monotonous crying than afraid.  I turned back away from the,The War of the Worlds,5968
36,"park and struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went",The War of the Worlds,5969
36,"along under the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this",The War of the Worlds,5970
36,"stationary, howling Martian from the direction of St. John's Wood.  A",The War of the Worlds,5971
36,"couple of hundred yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus,",The War of the Worlds,5972
36,"and saw, first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws",The War of the Worlds,5973
36,"coming headlong towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in",The War of the Worlds,5974
36,"pursuit of him.  He made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared",The War of the Worlds,5975
36,I might prove a fresh competitor.  As the yelping died away down the,The War of the Worlds,5976
36,"silent road, the wailing sound of ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" reasserted",The War of the Worlds,5977
36,itself.,The War of the Worlds,5978
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5979
36,I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John's Wood,The War of the Worlds,5980
36,station.  At first I thought a house had fallen across the road.  It,The War of the Worlds,5981
36,"was only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this",The War of the Worlds,5982
36,"mechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and",The War of the Worlds,5983
36,"twisted, among the ruins it had made.  The forepart was shattered.  It",The War of the Worlds,5984
36,"seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been",The War of the Worlds,5985
36,overwhelmed in its overthrow.  It seemed to me then that this might,The War of the Worlds,5986
36,have happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its,The War of the Worlds,5987
36,"Martian.  I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the",The War of the Worlds,5988
36,twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat,The War of the Worlds,5989
36,"was smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had",The War of the Worlds,5990
36,"left, were invisible to me.",The War of the Worlds,5991
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5992
36,"Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards",The War of the Worlds,5993
36,"Primrose Hill.  Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second",The War of the Worlds,5994
36,"Martian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards the",The War of the Worlds,5995
36,"Zoological Gardens, and silent.  A little beyond the ruins about the",The War of the Worlds,5996
36,"smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the",The War of the Worlds,5997
36,"Regent's Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.",The War of the Worlds,5998
36,"",The War of the Worlds,5999
36,"As I crossed the bridge, the sound of ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,""",The War of the Worlds,6000
36,"ceased.  It was, as it were, cut off.  The silence came like a",The War of the Worlds,6001
36,thunderclap.,The War of the Worlds,6002
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6003
36,The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees,The War of the Worlds,6004
36,towards the park were growing black.  All about me the red weed,The War of the Worlds,6005
36,"clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness.",The War of the Worlds,6006
36,"Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me.  But while",The War of the Worlds,6007
36,"that voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable;",The War of the Worlds,6008
36,"by virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life",The War of the Worlds,6009
36,"about me had upheld me.  Then suddenly a change, the passing of",The War of the Worlds,6010
36,something--I knew not what--and then a stillness that could be felt.,The War of the Worlds,6011
36,Nothing but this gaunt quiet.,The War of the Worlds,6012
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6013
36,London about me gazed at me spectrally.  The windows in the white,The War of the Worlds,6014
36,houses were like the eye sockets of skulls.  About me my imagination,The War of the Worlds,6015
36,"found a thousand noiseless enemies moving.  Terror seized me, a horror",The War of the Worlds,6016
36,of my temerity.  In front of me the road became pitchy black as though,The War of the Worlds,6017
36,"it was tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway.  I",The War of the Worlds,6018
36,"could not bring myself to go on.  I turned down St. John's Wood Road,",The War of the Worlds,6019
36,and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn.  I,The War of the Worlds,6020
36,"hid from the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a",The War of the Worlds,6021
36,cabmen's shelter in Harrow Road.  But before the dawn my courage,The War of the Worlds,6022
36,"returned, and while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more",The War of the Worlds,6023
36,"towards Regent's Park.  I missed my way among the streets, and",The War of the Worlds,6024
36,"presently saw down a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn,",The War of the Worlds,6025
36,"the curve of Primrose Hill.  On the summit, towering up to the fading",The War of the Worlds,6026
36,"stars, was a third Martian, erect and motionless like the others.",The War of the Worlds,6027
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6028
36,An insane resolve possessed me.  I would die and end it.  And I,The War of the Worlds,6029
36,would save myself even the trouble of killing myself.  I marched on,The War of the Worlds,6030
36,"recklessly towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the",The War of the Worlds,6031
36,"light grew, I saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and",The War of the Worlds,6032
36,"clustering about the hood.  At that my heart gave a bound, and I began",The War of the Worlds,6033
36,running along the road.,The War of the Worlds,6034
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6035
36,I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund's Terrace (I,The War of the Worlds,6036
36,waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from,The War of the Worlds,6037
36,"the waterworks towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass",The War of the Worlds,6038
36,before the rising of the sun.  Great mounds had been heaped about the,The War of the Worlds,6039
36,"crest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it--it was the final and",The War of the Worlds,6040
36,largest place the Martians had made--and from behind these heaps there,The War of the Worlds,6041
36,rose a thin smoke against the sky.  Against the sky line an eager dog,The War of the Worlds,6042
36,ran and disappeared.  The thought that had flashed into my mind grew,The War of the Worlds,6043
36,"real, grew credible.  I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling",The War of the Worlds,6044
36,"exultation, as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster.  Out",The War of the Worlds,6045
36,"of the hood hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds",The War of the Worlds,6046
36,pecked and tore.,The War of the Worlds,6047
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6048
36,In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood,The War of the Worlds,6049
36,"upon its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me.  A",The War of the Worlds,6050
36,"mighty space it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it,",The War of the Worlds,6051
36,huge mounds of material and strange shelter places.  And scattered,The War of the Worlds,6052
36,"about it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid",The War of the Worlds,6053
36,"handling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a",The War of the Worlds,6054
36,"row, were the Martians--_dead_!--slain by the putrefactive and disease",The War of the Worlds,6055
36,bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red,The War of the Worlds,6056
36,"weed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had failed, by",The War of the Worlds,6057
36,"the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.",The War of the Worlds,6058
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6059
36,"For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have",The War of the Worlds,6060
36,foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds.  These,The War of the Worlds,6061
36,germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of,The War of the Worlds,6062
36,things--taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here.,The War of the Worlds,6063
36,But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed,The War of the Worlds,6064
36,"resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to",The War of the Worlds,6065
36,"many--those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance--our",The War of the Worlds,6066
36,living frames are altogether immune.  But there are no bacteria in,The War of the Worlds,6067
36,"Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and",The War of the Worlds,6068
36,"fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow.  Already",The War of the Worlds,6069
36,"when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting",The War of the Worlds,6070
36,even as they went to and fro.  It was inevitable.  By the toll of a,The War of the Worlds,6071
36,"billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is",The War of the Worlds,6072
36,his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten,The War of the Worlds,6073
36,times as mighty as they are.  For neither do men live nor die in vain.,The War of the Worlds,6074
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6075
36,"Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in",The War of the Worlds,6076
36,"that great gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that must have",The War of the Worlds,6077
36,seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be.  To me also,The War of the Worlds,6078
36,at that time this death was incomprehensible.  All I knew was that,The War of the Worlds,6079
36,these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead.,The War of the Worlds,6080
36,For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been,The War of the Worlds,6081
36,"repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain",The War of the Worlds,6082
36,them in the night.,The War of the Worlds,6083
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6084
36,"I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously,",The War of the Worlds,6085
36,even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his,The War of the Worlds,6086
36,"rays.  The pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great and",The War of the Worlds,6087
36,"wonderful in their power and complexity, so unearthly in their",The War of the Worlds,6088
36,"tortuous forms, rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows",The War of the Worlds,6089
36,"towards the light.  A multitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over the",The War of the Worlds,6090
36,"bodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me.  Across",The War of the Worlds,6091
36,"the pit on its farther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the great",The War of the Worlds,6092
36,flying-machine with which they had been experimenting upon our denser,The War of the Worlds,6093
36,atmosphere when decay and death arrested them.  Death had come not a,The War of the Worlds,6094
36,day too soon.  At the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the,The War of the Worlds,6095
36,"huge fighting-machine that would fight no more for ever, at the",The War of the Worlds,6096
36,tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned,The War of the Worlds,6097
36,seats on the summit of Primrose Hill.,The War of the Worlds,6098
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6099
36,"I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed",The War of the Worlds,6100
36,"now in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen",The War of the Worlds,6101
36,"overnight, just as death had overtaken them.  The one had died, even",The War of the Worlds,6102
36,as it had been crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to,The War of the Worlds,6103
36,"die, and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of its",The War of the Worlds,6104
36,"machinery was exhausted.  They glittered now, harmless tripod towers",The War of the Worlds,6105
36,"of shining metal, in the brightness of the rising sun.",The War of the Worlds,6106
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6107
36,"All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlasting",The War of the Worlds,6108
36,"destruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities.  Those who have only",The War of the Worlds,6109
36,seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine,The War of the Worlds,6110
36,the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses.,The War of the Worlds,6111
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6112
36,"Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the",The War of the Worlds,6113
36,"splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clear",The War of the Worlds,6114
36,"sky, and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs",The War of the Worlds,6115
36,caught the light and glared with a white intensity.,The War of the Worlds,6116
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6117
36,"Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses;",The War of the Worlds,6118
36,"westward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the",The War of the Worlds,6119
36,"Martians, the green waves of Regent's Park, the Langham Hotel, the",The War of the Worlds,6120
36,"dome of the Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant",The War of the Worlds,6121
36,mansions of the Brompton Road came out clear and little in the,The War of the Worlds,6122
36,"sunrise, the jagged ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond.  Far",The War of the Worlds,6123
36,"away and blue were the Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal",The War of the Worlds,6124
36,Palace glittered like two silver rods.  The dome of St. Paul's was,The War of the Worlds,6125
36,"dark against the sunrise, and injured, I saw for the first time, by a",The War of the Worlds,6126
36,huge gaping cavity on its western side.,The War of the Worlds,6127
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6128
36,And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and,The War of the Worlds,6129
36,"churches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous",The War of the Worlds,6130
36,"hopes and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to",The War of the Worlds,6131
36,"build this human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that",The War of the Worlds,6132
36,had hung over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled,The War of the Worlds,6133
36,"back, and that men might still live in the streets, and this dear vast",The War of the Worlds,6134
36,"dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of",The War of the Worlds,6135
36,emotion that was near akin to tears.,The War of the Worlds,6136
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6137
36,The torment was over.  Even that day the healing would begin.  The,The War of the Worlds,6138
36,"survivors of the people scattered over the country--leaderless,",The War of the Worlds,6139
36,"lawless, foodless, like sheep without a shepherd--the thousands who",The War of the Worlds,6140
36,"had fled by sea, would begin to return; the pulse of life, growing",The War of the Worlds,6141
36,"stronger and stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour",The War of the Worlds,6142
36,"across the vacant squares.  Whatever destruction was done, the hand of",The War of the Worlds,6143
36,"the destroyer was stayed.  All the gaunt wrecks, the blackened",The War of the Worlds,6144
36,skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the,The War of the Worlds,6145
36,"hill, would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and",The War of the Worlds,6146
36,ringing with the tapping of their trowels.  At the thought I extended,The War of the Worlds,6147
36,"my hands towards the sky and began thanking God.  In a year, thought",The War of the Worlds,6148
36,I--in a year. . .,The War of the Worlds,6149
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6150

36,all that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping and,The War of the Worlds,6163
36,praising God upon the summit of Primrose Hill.  And then I forget.,The War of the Worlds,6164
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6165
36,"Of the next three days I know nothing.  I have learned since that,",The War of the Worlds,6166
36,"so far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow,",The War of the Worlds,6167
36,several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the,The War of the Worlds,6168
36,"previous night.  One man--the first--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand,",The War of the Worlds,6169
36,"and, while I sheltered in the cabmen's hut, had contrived to",The War of the Worlds,6170
36,telegraph to Paris.  Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the,The War of the Worlds,6171
36,"world; a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly",The War of the Worlds,6172
36,"flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin,",The War of the Worlds,6173
36,"Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the",The War of the Worlds,6174
36,"verge of the pit.  Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard,",The War of the Worlds,6175
36,"shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout, were making",The War of the Worlds,6176
36,"up trains, even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London.  The church",The War of the Worlds,6177
36,"bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news,",The War of the Worlds,6178
36,"until all England was bell-ringing.  Men on cycles, lean-faced,",The War of the Worlds,6179
36,"unkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped",The War of the Worlds,6180
36,"deliverance, shouting to gaunt, staring figures of despair.  And for",The War of the Worlds,6181
36,"the food!  Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the",The War of the Worlds,6182
36,"Atlantic, corn, bread, and meat were tearing to our relief.  All the",The War of the Worlds,6183
36,shipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days.  But of,The War of the Worlds,6184
36,all this I have no memory.  I drifted--a demented man.  I found myself,The War of the Worlds,6185
36,"in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third day",The War of the Worlds,6186
36,"wandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood.",The War of the Worlds,6187
36,They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about,The War of the Worlds,6188
36,"""The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!  The Last Man Left Alive!""  Troubled",The War of the Worlds,6189
36,"as they were with their own affairs, these people, whose name, much as",The War of the Worlds,6190
36,"I would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even give",The War of the Worlds,6191
36,"here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, sheltered me, and",The War of the Worlds,6192
36,protected me from myself.  Apparently they had learned something of my,The War of the Worlds,6193
36,story from me during the days of my lapse.,The War of the Worlds,6194
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6195
36,"Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me",The War of the Worlds,6196
36,what they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead.  Two days after I,The War of the Worlds,6197
36,"was imprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a",The War of the Worlds,6198
36,"Martian.  He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any",The War of the Worlds,6199
36,"provocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness",The War of the Worlds,6200
36,of power.,The War of the Worlds,6201
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6202
36,"I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me.  I was a lonely",The War of the Worlds,6203
36,"man and a sad one, and they bore with me.  I remained with them four",The War of the Worlds,6204
36,"days after my recovery.  All that time I felt a vague, a growing",The War of the Worlds,6205
36,craving to look once more on whatever remained of the little life that,The War of the Worlds,6206
36,seemed so happy and bright in my past.  It was a mere hopeless desire,The War of the Worlds,6207
36,to feast upon my misery.  They dissuaded me.  They did all they could,The War of the Worlds,6208
36,to divert me from this morbidity.  But at last I could resist the,The War of the Worlds,6209
36,"impulse no longer, and, promising faithfully to return to them, and",The War of the Worlds,6210
36,"parting, as I will confess, from these four-day friends with tears, I",The War of the Worlds,6211
36,went out again into the streets that had lately been so dark and,The War of the Worlds,6212
36,strange and empty.,The War of the Worlds,6213
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6214
36,Already they were busy with returning people; in places even there,The War of the Worlds,6215
36,"were shops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water.",The War of the Worlds,6216
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6217
36,I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my,The War of the Worlds,6218
36,"melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the",The War of the Worlds,6219
36,streets and vivid the moving life about me.  So many people were,The War of the Worlds,6220
36,"abroad everywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed",The War of the Worlds,6221
36,incredible that any great proportion of the population could have been,The War of the Worlds,6222
36,slain.  But then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I,The War of the Worlds,6223
36,"met, how shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes,",The War of the Worlds,6224
36,and that every other man still wore his dirty rags.  Their faces,The War of the Worlds,6225
36,seemed all with one of two expressions--a leaping exultation and,The War of the Worlds,6226
36,"energy or a grim resolution.  Save for the expression of the faces,",The War of the Worlds,6227
36,London seemed a city of tramps.  The vestries were indiscriminately,The War of the Worlds,6228
36,distributing bread sent us by the French government.  The ribs of the,The War of the Worlds,6229
36,few horses showed dismally.  Haggard special constables with white,The War of the Worlds,6230
36,badges stood at the corners of every street.  I saw little of the,The War of the Worlds,6231
36,"mischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Wellington Street,",The War of the Worlds,6232
36,and there I saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses of,The War of the Worlds,6233
36,Waterloo Bridge.,The War of the Worlds,6234
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6235
36,"At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts",The War of the Worlds,6236
36,of that grotesque time--a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket,The War of the Worlds,6237
36,"of the red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place.  It was",The War of the Worlds,6238
36,the placard of the first newspaper to resume publication--the _Daily,The War of the Worlds,6239
36,Mail_.  I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket.,The War of the Worlds,6240
36,"Most of it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing",The War of the Worlds,6241
36,had amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement,The War of the Worlds,6242
36,stereo on the back page.  The matter he printed was emotional; the,The War of the Worlds,6243
36,news organisation had not as yet found its way back.  I learned,The War of the Worlds,6244
36,nothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of the,The War of the Worlds,6245
36,Martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results.  Among other,The War of the Worlds,6246
36,"things, the article assured me what I did not believe at the time,",The War of the Worlds,6247
36,"that the ""Secret of Flying,"" was discovered.  At Waterloo I found the",The War of the Worlds,6248
36,free trains that were taking people to their homes.  The first rush,The War of the Worlds,6249
36,"was already over.  There were few people in the train, and I was in no",The War of the Worlds,6250
36,"mood for casual conversation.  I got a compartment to myself, and sat",The War of the Worlds,6251
36,"with folded arms, looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed",The War of the Worlds,6252
36,past the windows.  And just outside the terminus the train jolted over,The War of the Worlds,6253
36,"temporary rails, and on either side of the railway the houses were",The War of the Worlds,6254
36,blackened ruins.  To Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy,The War of the Worlds,6255
36,"with powder of the Black Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms",The War of the Worlds,6256
36,"and rain, and at Clapham Junction the line had been wrecked again;",The War of the Worlds,6257
36,there were hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by,The War of the Worlds,6258
36,"side with the customary navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty",The War of the Worlds,6259
36,relaying.,The War of the Worlds,6260
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6261
36,All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt,The War of the Worlds,6262
36,"and unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered.  Walton, by virtue",The War of the Worlds,6263
36,"of its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along",The War of the Worlds,6264
36,"the line.  The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped",The War of the Worlds,6265
36,"mass of red weed, in appearance between butcher's meat and pickled",The War of the Worlds,6266
36,"cabbage.  The Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons",The War of the Worlds,6267
36,"of the red climber.  Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in",The War of the Worlds,6268
36,"certain nursery grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the",The War of the Worlds,6269
36,"sixth cylinder.  A number of people were standing about it, and some",The War of the Worlds,6270
36,"sappers were busy in the midst of it.  Over it flaunted a Union Jack,",The War of the Worlds,6271
36,flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze.  The nursery grounds were,The War of the Worlds,6272
36,"everywhere crimson with the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut",The War of the Worlds,6273
36,"with purple shadows, and very painful to the eye.  One's gaze went",The War of the Worlds,6274
36,with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the,The War of the Worlds,6275
36,foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills.,The War of the Worlds,6276
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6277
36,The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing,The War of the Worlds,6278
36,"repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to",The War of the Worlds,6279
36,"Maybury, past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the",The War of the Worlds,6280
36,"hussars, and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in",The War of the Worlds,6281
36,"the thunderstorm.  Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find,",The War of the Worlds,6282
36,"among a tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the",The War of the Worlds,6283
36,whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed.  For a time I stood,The War of the Worlds,6284
36,regarding these vestiges. . . .,The War of the Worlds,6285
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6286
36,"Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here",The War of the Worlds,6287
36,"and there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found",The War of the Worlds,6288
36,"burial, and so came home past the College Arms.  A man standing at an",The War of the Worlds,6289
36,open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed.,The War of the Worlds,6290
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6291
36,I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded,The War of the Worlds,6292
36,immediately.  The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening,The War of the Worlds,6293
36,slowly as I approached.,The War of the Worlds,6294
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6295
36,It slammed again.  The curtains of my study fluttered out of the,The War of the Worlds,6296
36,open window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn.  No,The War of the Worlds,6297
36,one had closed it since.  The smashed bushes were just as I had left,The War of the Worlds,6298
36,"them nearly four weeks ago.  I stumbled into the hall, and the house",The War of the Worlds,6299
36,felt empty.  The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had,The War of the Worlds,6300
36,"crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the",The War of the Worlds,6301
36,catastrophe.  Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs.,The War of the Worlds,6302
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6303
36,"I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table",The War of the Worlds,6304
36,"still, with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had",The War of the Worlds,6305
36,left on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder.  For a space I,The War of the Worlds,6306
36,stood reading over my abandoned arguments.  It was a paper on the,The War of the Worlds,6307
36,probable development of Moral Ideas with the development of the,The War of the Worlds,6308
36,civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening of a,The War of the Worlds,6309
36,"prophecy: ""In about two hundred years,"" I had written, ""we may",The War of the Worlds,6310
36,"expect----""  The sentence ended abruptly.  I remembered my inability",The War of the Worlds,6311
36,"to fix my mind that morning, scarcely a month gone by, and how I had",The War of the Worlds,6312
36,broken off to get my _Daily Chronicle_ from the newsboy.  I remembered,The War of the Worlds,6313
36,"how I went down to the garden gate as he came along, and how I had",The War of the Worlds,6314
36,"listened to his odd story of ""Men from Mars.""",The War of the Worlds,6315
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6316
36,I came down and went into the dining room.  There were the mutton,The War of the Worlds,6317
36,"and the bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle",The War of the Worlds,6318
36,"overturned, just as I and the artilleryman had left them.  My home was",The War of the Worlds,6319
36,desolate.  I perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so,The War of the Worlds,6320
36,"long.  And then a strange thing occurred.  ""It is no use,"" said a",The War of the Worlds,6321
36,"voice.  ""The house is deserted.  No one has been here these ten days.",The War of the Worlds,6322
36,"Do not stay here to torment yourself.  No one escaped but you.""",The War of the Worlds,6323
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6324
36,"I was startled.  Had I spoken my thought aloud?  I turned, and the",The War of the Worlds,6325
36,"French window was open behind me.  I made a step to it, and stood",The War of the Worlds,6326
36,looking out.,The War of the Worlds,6327
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6328
36,"And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid,",The War of the Worlds,6329

36,faint cry.,The War of the Worlds,6331
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6332
36,"""I came,"" she said.  ""I knew--knew----""",The War of the Worlds,6333

36,"My knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two,",The War of the Worlds,6349
36,but it seems to me that Carver's suggestions as to the reason of the,The War of the Worlds,6350

36,"species were found.  That they did not bury any of their dead, and the",The War of the Worlds,6356
36,"reckless slaughter they perpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance",The War of the Worlds,6357
36,"of the putrefactive process.  But probable as this seems, it is by no",The War of the Worlds,6358

36,"",The War of the Worlds,6360

36,"Martians used with such deadly effect, and the generator of the",The War of the Worlds,6362
36,Heat-Rays remains a puzzle.  The terrible disasters at the Ealing,The War of the Worlds,6363
36,and South Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further,The War of the Worlds,6364
36,investigations upon the latter.  Spectrum analysis of the black powder,The War of the Worlds,6365
36,points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a,The War of the Worlds,6366
36,"brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that",The War of the Worlds,6367
36,it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with,The War of the Worlds,6368
36,deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood.  But such unproven,The War of the Worlds,6369
36,"speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to",The War of the Worlds,6370
36,whom this story is addressed.  None of the brown scum that drifted,The War of the Worlds,6371
36,down the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at,The War of the Worlds,6372
36,"the time, and now none is forthcoming.",The War of the Worlds,6373
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6374
36,"The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far",The War of the Worlds,6375
36,"as the prowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have",The War of the Worlds,6376
36,already given.  But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and,The War of the Worlds,6377
36,"almost complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and",The War of the Worlds,6378
36,the countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that,The War of the Worlds,6379
36,the interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific.,The War of the Worlds,6380
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6381
36,A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of,The War of the Worlds,6382
36,another attack from the Martians.  I do not think that nearly enough,The War of the Worlds,6383
36,attention is being given to this aspect of the matter.  At present the,The War of the Worlds,6384
36,"planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I,",The War of the Worlds,6385
36,"for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure.  In any case, we",The War of the Worlds,6386
36,should be prepared.  It seems to me that it should be possible to,The War of the Worlds,6387
36,"define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to",The War of the Worlds,6388
36,"keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate",The War of the Worlds,6389
36,the arrival of the next attack.,The War of the Worlds,6390
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6391
36,In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or,The War of the Worlds,6392
36,"artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge,",The War of the Worlds,6393
36,or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw,The War of the Worlds,6394
36,opened.  It seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the,The War of the Worlds,6395
36,failure of their first surprise.  Possibly they see it in the same,The War of the Worlds,6396
36,light.,The War of the Worlds,6397
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6398
36,Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the,The War of the Worlds,6399
36,Martians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet,The War of the Worlds,6400
36,"Venus.  Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with",The War of the Worlds,6401
36,"the sun; that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view",The War of the Worlds,6402
36,of an observer on Venus.  Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous,The War of the Worlds,6403
36,"marking appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and",The War of the Worlds,6404
36,almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character,The War of the Worlds,6405
36,was detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk.  One needs to see,The War of the Worlds,6406
36,the drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their,The War of the Worlds,6407
36,remarkable resemblance in character.,The War of the Worlds,6408
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6409
36,"At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views",The War of the Worlds,6410
36,of the human future must be greatly modified by these events.  We have,The War of the Worlds,6411
36,learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a,The War of the Worlds,6412
36,secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good,The War of the Worlds,6413
36,or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space.  It may be that,The War of the Worlds,6414
36,in the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not,The War of the Worlds,6415
36,without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene,The War of the Worlds,6416
36,confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of,The War of the Worlds,6417
36,"decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and",The War of the Worlds,6418
36,it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of,The War of the Worlds,6419
36,mankind.  It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians,The War of the Worlds,6420
36,have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their,The War of the Worlds,6421
36,"lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer",The War of the Worlds,6422
36,"settlement.  Be that as it may, for many years yet there will",The War of the Worlds,6423
36,"certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk,",The War of the Worlds,6424
36,"and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with",The War of the Worlds,6425
36,them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.,The War of the Worlds,6426
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6427
36,The broadening of men's views that has resulted can scarcely be,The War of the Worlds,6428
36,exaggerated.  Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion,The War of the Worlds,6429
36,that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty,The War of the Worlds,6430
36,surface of our minute sphere.  Now we see further.  If the Martians,The War of the Worlds,6431
36,"can reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is",The War of the Worlds,6432
36,"impossible for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this",The War of the Worlds,6433
36,"earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread",The War of the Worlds,6434
36,of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our,The War of the Worlds,6435
36,sister planet within its toils.,The War of the Worlds,6436
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6437
36,Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of,The War of the Worlds,6438
36,life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system,The War of the Worlds,6439
36,throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space.  But that is a,The War of the Worlds,6440
36,"remote dream.  It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of",The War of the Worlds,6441
36,"the Martians is only a reprieve.  To them, and not to us, perhaps, is",The War of the Worlds,6442
36,the future ordained.,The War of the Worlds,6443
36,"",The War of the Worlds,6444
36,I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an,The War of the Worlds,6445
36,abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind.  I sit in my study,The War of the Worlds,6446
36,"writing by lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley",The War of the Worlds,6447
36,"below set with writhing flames, and feel the house behind and about me",The War of the Worlds,6448
36,"empty and desolate.  I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass",The War of the Worlds,6449
36,"me, a butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a",The War of the Worlds,6450
36,"bicycle, children going to school, and suddenly they become vague and",The War of the Worlds,6451
36,"unreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot,",The War of the Worlds,6452
36,brooding silence.  Of a night I see the black powder darkening the,The War of the Worlds,6453
36,"silent streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they",The War of the Worlds,6454
36,"rise upon me tattered and dog-bitten.  They gibber and grow fiercer,",The War of the Worlds,6455
36,"paler, uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold",The War of the Worlds,6456

36,"",The War of the Worlds,6458

1342,the report which was in general circulation within five minutes,Pride and Prejudice,6757

1342,"her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's",Pride and Prejudice,6826

1342,"fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they",Pride and Prejudice,6829

1342,"spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they",Pride and Prejudice,6831
1342,were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With,Pride and Prejudice,6832

1342,good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised,Pride and Prejudice,6834
1342,such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on,Pride and Prejudice,6835

1342,Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister,Pride and Prejudice,8932

1342,"at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,",Pride and Prejudice,8934
1342,and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed,Pride and Prejudice,8935
1342,"him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with",Pride and Prejudice,8936
1342,"one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.",Pride and Prejudice,8937
1342,"Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such",Pride and Prejudice,8938
1342,doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been,Pride and Prejudice,8939
1342,"always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told",Pride and Prejudice,8940
1342,"Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the",Pride and Prejudice,8941
1342,"house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,",Pride and Prejudice,8942
1342,was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their,Pride and Prejudice,8943
1342,"walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker",Pride and Prejudice,8944
1342,"than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.",Pride and Prejudice,8945
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,8946

1342,the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were,Pride and Prejudice,8949
1342,"immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and",Pride and Prejudice,8950
1342,"nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in",Pride and Prejudice,8951

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,8953

1342,"they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking",Pride and Prejudice,8955
1342,with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was,Pride and Prejudice,8956
1342,the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came,Pride and Prejudice,8957
1342,"to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the",Pride and Prejudice,8958
1342,"stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,",Pride and Prejudice,8959
1342,"determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under",Pride and Prejudice,8960
1342,"pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately",Pride and Prejudice,8961
1342,"had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had",Pride and Prejudice,8962
1342,"reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated",Pride and Prejudice,8963
1342,"permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with",Pride and Prejudice,8964
1342,"him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a",Pride and Prejudice,8965
1342,commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the,Pride and Prejudice,8966
1342,young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.,Pride and Prejudice,8967
1342,His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of,Pride and Prejudice,8968
1342,"beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.",Pride and Prejudice,8969
1342,The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness,Pride and Prejudice,8970
1342,of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and,Pride and Prejudice,8971
1342,unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together,Pride and Prejudice,8972
1342,"very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy",Pride and Prejudice,8973
1342,and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the,Pride and Prejudice,8974
1342,"ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and",Pride and Prejudice,8975
1342,"began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and",Pride and Prejudice,8976
1342,"Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to",Pride and Prejudice,8977
1342,Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated,Pride and Prejudice,8978
1342,"it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes",Pride and Prejudice,8979
1342,"on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the",Pride and Prejudice,8980
1342,"stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they",Pride and Prejudice,8981
1342,"looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.",Pride and Prejudice,8982
1342,"Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,",Pride and Prejudice,8983
1342,"after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just",Pride and Prejudice,8984
1342,deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to,Pride and Prejudice,8985
1342,imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.,Pride and Prejudice,8986
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,8987
1342,"In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what",Pride and Prejudice,8988
1342,"passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.",Pride and Prejudice,8989
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,8990
1342,Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of,Pride and Prejudice,8991
1342,"Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's",Pride and Prejudice,8992
1342,"pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of",Pride and Prejudice,8993

1342,invitation.,Pride and Prejudice,8995
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,8996
1342,"Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,",Pride and Prejudice,8997
1342,"from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was",Pride and Prejudice,8998
1342,"eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as",Pride and Prejudice,8999
1342,"their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing",Pride and Prejudice,9000
1342,"about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the",Pride and Prejudice,9001
1342,"street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to",Pride and Prejudice,9002
1342,"Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility",Pride and Prejudice,9003
1342,was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She,Pride and Prejudice,9004
1342,"received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with",Pride and Prejudice,9005
1342,"as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous",Pride and Prejudice,9006
1342,"acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,",Pride and Prejudice,9007
1342,"however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who",Pride and Prejudice,9008
1342,introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an,Pride and Prejudice,9009
1342,excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon,Pride and Prejudice,9010
1342,"put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,",Pride and Prejudice,9011
1342,"however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that",Pride and Prejudice,9012
1342,"Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a",Pride and Prejudice,9013
1342,lieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the,Pride and Prejudice,9014
1342,"last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.",Pride and Prejudice,9015
1342,"Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the",Pride and Prejudice,9016
1342,"occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the",Pride and Prejudice,9017
1342,"officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become ""stupid,",Pride and Prejudice,9018
1342,"disagreeable fellows."" Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses",Pride and Prejudice,9019
1342,"the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.",Pride and Prejudice,9020
1342,"Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn",Pride and Prejudice,9021
1342,"would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips",Pride and Prejudice,9022
1342,protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery,Pride and Prejudice,9023
1342,"tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such",Pride and Prejudice,9024
1342,"delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.",Pride and Prejudice,9025
1342,"Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured",Pride and Prejudice,9026
1342,with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.,Pride and Prejudice,9027
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9028
1342,"As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass",Pride and Prejudice,9029
1342,between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either,Pride and Prejudice,9030

1342,"pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although",Pride and Prejudice,9038
1342,"utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be",Pride and Prejudice,9039
1342,"attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so",Pride and Prejudice,9040

1342,"heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as",Pride and Prejudice,9073

1342,"invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed",Pride and Prejudice,9456
1342,for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their,Pride and Prejudice,9457

1342,asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To,Pride and Prejudice,9459

1342,"as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to",Pride and Prejudice,9461
1342,"the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an",Pride and Prejudice,9462

1342,"by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a",Pride and Prejudice,9469

1342,Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.,Pride and Prejudice,9472
1342,"Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look",Pride and Prejudice,9473

1342,"less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they",Pride and Prejudice,9475
1342,"each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,",Pride and Prejudice,9476

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9504
1342,Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being,Pride and Prejudice,9505

1342,instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help,Pride and Prejudice,9507

1342,"delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as",Pride and Prejudice,9509
1342,good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his,Pride and Prejudice,9510
1342,gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first,Pride and Prejudice,9511
1342,"struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy",Pride and Prejudice,9512
1342,"of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a",Pride and Prejudice,9513

1342,"gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before",Pride and Prejudice,9518
1342,her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage,Pride and Prejudice,9519
1342,"was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose",Pride and Prejudice,9520
1342,"to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the",Pride and Prejudice,9521
1342,"consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and",Pride and Prejudice,9522

1342,"Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in",Pride and Prejudice,9541
1342,"vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a",Pride and Prejudice,9542
1342,doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty,Pride and Prejudice,9543
1342,of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that,Pride and Prejudice,9544
1342,might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than,Pride and Prejudice,9545
1342,"usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all",Pride and Prejudice,9546
1342,"that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than",Pride and Prejudice,9547

1342,"this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was",Pride and Prejudice,9551
1342,"pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who",Pride and Prejudice,9552
1342,told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the,Pride and Prejudice,9553
1342,"day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,",Pride and Prejudice,9554
1342,"""I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if",Pride and Prejudice,9555

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9557

1342,"Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every",Pride and Prejudice,9560
1342,feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate,Pride and Prejudice,9561
1342,"disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to",Pride and Prejudice,9562
1342,the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.,Pride and Prejudice,9563
1342,"Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She",Pride and Prejudice,9564
1342,"was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away",Pride and Prejudice,9565
1342,with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in,Pride and Prejudice,9566
1342,"speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.",Pride and Prejudice,9567
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9568
1342,But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect,Pride and Prejudice,9569
1342,"of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her",Pride and Prejudice,9570
1342,"spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had",Pride and Prejudice,9571
1342,"not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition",Pride and Prejudice,9572
1342,"to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular",Pride and Prejudice,9573
1342,"notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;",Pride and Prejudice,9574
1342,"they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,",Pride and Prejudice,9575
1342,"apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being",Pride and Prejudice,9576
1342,"aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable",Pride and Prejudice,9577
1342,partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from,Pride and Prejudice,9578

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9580
1342,"She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of",Pride and Prejudice,9581

1342,"without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again",Pride and Prejudice,9586

1342,in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no,Pride and Prejudice,9599

1342,"reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding",Pride and Prejudice,9602

1342,"imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at",Pride and Prejudice,9604
1342,first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would,Pride and Prejudice,9605

1342,"some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again",Pride and Prejudice,9607
1342,"silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time",Pride and Prejudice,9608
1342,"with:--""It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked",Pride and Prejudice,9609
1342,"about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size",Pride and Prejudice,9610
1342,"of the room, or the number of couples.""",Pride and Prejudice,9611

1342,"Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to",Pride and Prejudice,9749
1342,give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's,Pride and Prejudice,9750
1342,"using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has",Pride and Prejudice,9751
1342,"always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated",Pride and Prejudice,9752

1342,"I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he",Pride and Prejudice,9754

1342,"the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself",Pride and Prejudice,9757
1342,out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent,Pride and Prejudice,9758
1342,"thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,",Pride and Prejudice,9759

1342,"in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to",Pride and Prejudice,9832

1342,"assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.""",Pride and Prejudice,9840
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9841
1342,"Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him",Pride and Prejudice,9842
1342,that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction,Pride and Prejudice,9843
1342,"as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that",Pride and Prejudice,9844
1342,it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either,Pride and Prejudice,9845
1342,"side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in",Pride and Prejudice,9846
1342,"consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her",Pride and Prejudice,9847
1342,"with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she",Pride and Prejudice,9848
1342,"ceased speaking, replied thus:",Pride and Prejudice,9849
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9850
1342,"""My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in",Pride and Prejudice,9851

1342,"understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide",Pride and Prejudice,9853
1342,"difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,",Pride and Prejudice,9854
1342,"and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that",Pride and Prejudice,9855
1342,I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with,Pride and Prejudice,9856
1342,the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of,Pride and Prejudice,9857
1342,behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to,Pride and Prejudice,9858
1342,"follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to",Pride and Prejudice,9859
1342,perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to,Pride and Prejudice,9860
1342,"profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant",Pride and Prejudice,9861
1342,"guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by",Pride and Prejudice,9862
1342,education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young,Pride and Prejudice,9863
1342,"lady like yourself."" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.",Pride and Prejudice,9864
1342,"Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose",Pride and Prejudice,9865
1342,astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced,Pride and Prejudice,9866
1342,his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of,Pride and Prejudice,9867
1342,"it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the",Pride and Prejudice,9868
1342,"words ""apology,"" ""Hunsford,"" and ""Lady Catherine de Bourgh."" It vexed",Pride and Prejudice,9869
1342,her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him,Pride and Prejudice,9870
1342,"with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time",Pride and Prejudice,9871
1342,"to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,",Pride and Prejudice,9872
1342,"was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed",Pride and Prejudice,9873
1342,"abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the",Pride and Prejudice,9874
1342,"end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.",Pride and Prejudice,9875
1342,Collins then returned to Elizabeth.,Pride and Prejudice,9876
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9877
1342,"""I have no reason, I assure you,"" said he, ""to be dissatisfied with my",Pride and Prejudice,9878
1342,reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered,Pride and Prejudice,9879
1342,"me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying",Pride and Prejudice,9880
1342,that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be,Pride and Prejudice,9881
1342,certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very,Pride and Prejudice,9882
1342,"handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.""",Pride and Prejudice,9883
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9884
1342,"As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned",Pride and Prejudice,9885
1342,her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the,Pride and Prejudice,9886
1342,"train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,",Pride and Prejudice,9887
1342,made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in,Pride and Prejudice,9888
1342,"that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection",Pride and Prejudice,9889
1342,"could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of",Pride and Prejudice,9890
1342,endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts,Pride and Prejudice,9891
1342,"she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to",Pride and Prejudice,9892
1342,"venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to",Pride and Prejudice,9893
1342,"supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which",Pride and Prejudice,9894
1342,placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find,Pride and Prejudice,9895
1342,"that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,",Pride and Prejudice,9896
1342,"openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon",Pride and Prejudice,9897
1342,"be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet",Pride and Prejudice,9898
1342,seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the,Pride and Prejudice,9899
1342,"match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but",Pride and Prejudice,9900
1342,"three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and",Pride and Prejudice,9901
1342,then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of,Pride and Prejudice,9902
1342,"Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as",Pride and Prejudice,9903
1342,"she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger",Pride and Prejudice,9904
1342,"daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of",Pride and Prejudice,9905
1342,"other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be",Pride and Prejudice,9906
1342,"able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that",Pride and Prejudice,9907
1342,she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was,Pride and Prejudice,9908
1342,"necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on",Pride and Prejudice,9909
1342,such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice,9910
1342,Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She,Pride and Prejudice,9911
1342,concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally,Pride and Prejudice,9912
1342,"fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no",Pride and Prejudice,9913
1342,chance of it.,Pride and Prejudice,9914
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9915
1342,In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's,Pride and Prejudice,9916
1342,"words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible",Pride and Prejudice,9917
1342,"whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the",Pride and Prejudice,9918
1342,"chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her",Pride and Prejudice,9919
1342,mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.,Pride and Prejudice,9920
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9921
1342,"""What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am",Pride and Prejudice,9922
1342,sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say,Pride and Prejudice,9923

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9929
1342,"Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would",Pride and Prejudice,9930
1342,talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and,Pride and Prejudice,9931
1342,blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently,Pride and Prejudice,9932
1342,"glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what",Pride and Prejudice,9933
1342,"she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was",Pride and Prejudice,9934
1342,convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression,Pride and Prejudice,9935
1342,of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and,Pride and Prejudice,9936
1342,steady gravity.,Pride and Prejudice,9937
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9938
1342,"At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who",Pride and Prejudice,9939
1342,had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no,Pride and Prejudice,9940
1342,"likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and",Pride and Prejudice,9941
1342,chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of,Pride and Prejudice,9942
1342,"tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and",Pride and Prejudice,9943
1342,"she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,",Pride and Prejudice,9944
1342,preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent,Pride and Prejudice,9945
1342,"entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,",Pride and Prejudice,9946
1342,but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of,Pride and Prejudice,9947
1342,"exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's",Pride and Prejudice,9948
1342,"eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her",Pride and Prejudice,9949
1342,progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very,Pride and Prejudice,9950
1342,"ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks",Pride and Prejudice,9951
1342,"of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to",Pride and Prejudice,9952
1342,"favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.",Pride and Prejudice,9953
1342,Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was,Pride and Prejudice,9954
1342,"weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at",Pride and Prejudice,9955
1342,"Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to",Pride and Prejudice,9956
1342,"Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs",Pride and Prejudice,9957
1342,"of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,",Pride and Prejudice,9958
1342,imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his,Pride and Prejudice,9959
1342,"interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,",Pride and Prejudice,9960
1342,"and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, ""That will do",Pride and Prejudice,9961
1342,"extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other",Pride and Prejudice,9962
1342,"young ladies have time to exhibit.""",Pride and Prejudice,9963
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9964
1342,"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and",Pride and Prejudice,9965
1342,"Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid",Pride and Prejudice,9966
1342,her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.,Pride and Prejudice,9967
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,9968
1342,"""If I,"" said Mr. Collins, ""were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I",Pride and Prejudice,9969
1342,"should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an",Pride and Prejudice,9970
1342,"air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly",Pride and Prejudice,9971
1342,"compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,",Pride and Prejudice,9972
1342,to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time,Pride and Prejudice,9973
1342,"to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The",Pride and Prejudice,9974
1342,"rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make",Pride and Prejudice,9975
1342,such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not,Pride and Prejudice,9976
1342,offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time,Pride and Prejudice,9977
1342,"that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care",Pride and Prejudice,9978
1342,"and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making",Pride and Prejudice,9979
1342,as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance,Pride and Prejudice,9980
1342,"that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,",Pride and Prejudice,9981
1342,especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit,Pride and Prejudice,9982
1342,him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an,Pride and Prejudice,9983
1342,occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the,Pride and Prejudice,9984
1342,"family."" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had",Pride and Prejudice,9985
1342,been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many,Pride and Prejudice,9986

1342,"wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,",Pride and Prejudice,9988
1342,"and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably",Pride and Prejudice,9989

1342,have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or,Pride and Prejudice,9994
1342,finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister,Pride and Prejudice,9995
1342,"that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his",Pride and Prejudice,9996
1342,feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he,Pride and Prejudice,9997
1342,"must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should",Pride and Prejudice,9998
1342,"have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,",Pride and Prejudice,9999
1342,and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the,Pride and Prejudice,10000

1342,"Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though",Pride and Prejudice,10004
1342,"he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her",Pride and Prejudice,10005
1342,power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with,Pride and Prejudice,10006
1342,"somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.",Pride and Prejudice,10007
1342,"He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;",Pride and Prejudice,10008
1342,that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to,Pride and Prejudice,10009
1342,her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her,Pride and Prejudice,10010
1342,the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed,Pride and Prejudice,10011
1342,"her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and",Pride and Prejudice,10012

1342,"a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of",Pride and Prejudice,10022
1342,"an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how",Pride and Prejudice,10023
1342,heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her,Pride and Prejudice,10024
1342,"sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and",Pride and Prejudice,10025
1342,were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed,Pride and Prejudice,10026
1342,"every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a",Pride and Prejudice,10027
1342,"languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the",Pride and Prejudice,10028
1342,"long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his",Pride and Prejudice,10029
1342,"sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and",Pride and Prejudice,10030
1342,politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said,Pride and Prejudice,10031
1342,"nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.",Pride and Prejudice,10032
1342,"Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the",Pride and Prejudice,10033

1342,no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at,Pride and Prejudice,10066
1342,"the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the",Pride and Prejudice,10067

1342,"finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,",Pride and Prejudice,10069

1342,"""May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,",Pride and Prejudice,10072

1342,"will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I",Pride and Prejudice,10078

1342,"Collins.""",Pride and Prejudice,10089
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,10090
1342,Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's,Pride and Prejudice,10091
1342,consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it,Pride and Prejudice,10092
1342,"over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to",Pride and Prejudice,10093
1342,"conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between",Pride and Prejudice,10094
1342,"distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as",Pride and Prejudice,10095
1342,"they were gone, Mr. Collins began.",Pride and Prejudice,10096
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,10097
1342,"""Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from",Pride and Prejudice,10098
1342,"doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You",Pride and Prejudice,10099
1342,would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little,Pride and Prejudice,10100
1342,"unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected",Pride and Prejudice,10101
1342,mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the,Pride and Prejudice,10102
1342,"purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to",Pride and Prejudice,10103
1342,dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as,Pride and Prejudice,10104

1342,my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this,Pride and Prejudice,10106
1342,"subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for",Pride and Prejudice,10107
1342,"marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design",Pride and Prejudice,10108
1342,"of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.""",Pride and Prejudice,10109

1342,"not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,",Pride and Prejudice,10113
1342,and he continued:,Pride and Prejudice,10114
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,10115
1342,"""My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for",Pride and Prejudice,10116
1342,every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example,Pride and Prejudice,10117
1342,"of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will",Pride and Prejudice,10118
1342,add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought,Pride and Prejudice,10119
1342,"to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and",Pride and Prejudice,10120
1342,recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling,Pride and Prejudice,10121
1342,patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked,Pride and Prejudice,10122
1342,too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I,Pride and Prejudice,10123
1342,"left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was",Pride and Prejudice,10124
1342,"arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you",Pride and Prejudice,10125
1342,"must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose",Pride and Prejudice,10126
1342,"a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,",Pride and Prejudice,10127
1342,"useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small",Pride and Prejudice,10128
1342,income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as,Pride and Prejudice,10129
1342,"you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the",Pride and Prejudice,10130
1342,"way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice",Pride and Prejudice,10131
1342,and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the,Pride and Prejudice,10132
1342,advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond,Pride and Prejudice,10133
1342,"anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be",Pride and Prejudice,10134
1342,"acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and",Pride and Prejudice,10135
1342,respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general,Pride and Prejudice,10136
1342,intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views,Pride and Prejudice,10137
1342,"were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I",Pride and Prejudice,10138
1342,"can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that",Pride and Prejudice,10139
1342,"being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured",Pride and Prejudice,10140
1342,"father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy",Pride and Prejudice,10141
1342,"myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that",Pride and Prejudice,10142
1342,"the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy",Pride and Prejudice,10143
1342,"event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not",Pride and Prejudice,10144
1342,"be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and",Pride and Prejudice,10145
1342,I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing,Pride and Prejudice,10146
1342,remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the,Pride and Prejudice,10147
1342,"violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and",Pride and Prejudice,10148
1342,"shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well",Pride and Prejudice,10149
1342,aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds,Pride and Prejudice,10150
1342,"in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's",Pride and Prejudice,10151
1342,"decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,",Pride and Prejudice,10152
1342,"therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that",Pride and Prejudice,10153
1342,"no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.""",Pride and Prejudice,10154

1342,the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of,Pride and Prejudice,10160
1342,"your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to",Pride and Prejudice,10161
1342,"decline them.""",Pride and Prejudice,10162

1342,"man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their",Pride and Prejudice,10166

1342,third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just,Pride and Prejudice,10168

1342,daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second,Pride and Prejudice,10174
1342,time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_,Pride and Prejudice,10175
1342,"happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who",Pride and Prejudice,10176
1342,"could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I",Pride and Prejudice,10177
1342,am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the,Pride and Prejudice,10178
1342,"situation.""",Pride and Prejudice,10179
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,10180

1342,"very gravely--""but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all",Pride and Prejudice,10182
1342,disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of,Pride and Prejudice,10183
1342,"seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your",Pride and Prejudice,10184
1342,"modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.""",Pride and Prejudice,10185
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,10186

1342,"refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.",Pride and Prejudice,10190

1342,"humour,"" said she, ""and I am more obliged to you than I can express.""",Pride and Prejudice,10642
1342,"Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and",Pride and Prejudice,10643
1342,that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was,Pride and Prejudice,10644
1342,"very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth",Pride and Prejudice,10645
1342,had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her,Pride and Prejudice,10646
1342,"from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards",Pride and Prejudice,10647
1342,herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so,Pride and Prejudice,10648
1342,"favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost",Pride and Prejudice,10649
1342,secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very,Pride and Prejudice,10650
1342,soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his,Pride and Prejudice,10651
1342,"character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next",Pride and Prejudice,10652
1342,"morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw",Pride and Prejudice,10653
1342,"himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,",Pride and Prejudice,10654
1342,"from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to",Pride and Prejudice,10655
1342,"conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known",Pride and Prejudice,10656
1342,till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost,Pride and Prejudice,10657
1342,"secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,",Pride and Prejudice,10658
1342,he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.,Pride and Prejudice,10659
1342,"His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas",Pride and Prejudice,10660
1342,"perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and",Pride and Prejudice,10661
1342,instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had,Pride and Prejudice,10662
1342,she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.,Pride and Prejudice,10663
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,10664
1342,"In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,",Pride and Prejudice,10665
1342,everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as,Pride and Prejudice,10666
1342,they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that,Pride and Prejudice,10667
1342,was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must,Pride and Prejudice,10668
1342,"be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with",Pride and Prejudice,10669
1342,his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must,Pride and Prejudice,10670
1342,guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its,Pride and Prejudice,10671
1342,"continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure",Pride and Prejudice,10672
1342,"and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that",Pride and Prejudice,10673
1342,establishment were gained.,Pride and Prejudice,10674
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,10675
1342,Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;,Pride and Prejudice,10676
1342,and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present,Pride and Prejudice,10677
1342,"circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom",Pride and Prejudice,10678
1342,they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were,Pride and Prejudice,10679
1342,"exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more",Pride and Prejudice,10680
1342,"interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer",Pride and Prejudice,10681
1342,Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided,Pride and Prejudice,10682
1342,"opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the",Pride and Prejudice,10683
1342,"Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife",Pride and Prejudice,10684
1342,"should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,",Pride and Prejudice,10685
1342,were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes,Pride and Prejudice,10686
1342,of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have,Pride and Prejudice,10687
1342,done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's,Pride and Prejudice,10688
1342,dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had,Pride and Prejudice,10689
1342,"gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were",Pride and Prejudice,10690
1342,"in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible",Pride and Prejudice,10691
1342,"nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must",Pride and Prejudice,10692
1342,be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly,Pride and Prejudice,10693
1342,"either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was",Pride and Prejudice,10694
1342,"the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,",Pride and Prejudice,10695
1342,"and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest",Pride and Prejudice,10696
1342,preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at,Pride and Prejudice,10697
1342,"the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all",Pride and Prejudice,10698
1342,the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business,Pride and Prejudice,10699
1342,"was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship",Pride and Prejudice,10700
1342,"she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,",Pride and Prejudice,10701
1342,and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be,Pride and Prejudice,10702
1342,"shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved",Pride and Prejudice,10703
1342,"to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,",Pride and Prejudice,10704
1342,"when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had",Pride and Prejudice,10705
1342,passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very,Pride and Prejudice,10706
1342,"dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the",Pride and Prejudice,10707
1342,curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct,Pride and Prejudice,10708
1342,"questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was",Pride and Prejudice,10709
1342,"at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to",Pride and Prejudice,10710
1342,publish his prosperous love.,Pride and Prejudice,10711
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,10712
1342,As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the,Pride and Prejudice,10713
1342,"family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved",Pride and Prejudice,10714

1342,"said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever",Pride and Prejudice,10716

1342,understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her,Pride and Prejudice,10750
1342,"younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.",Pride and Prejudice,10751

1342,"satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never",Pride and Prejudice,10786
1342,was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's,Pride and Prejudice,10787
1342,"character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my",Pride and Prejudice,10788

1342,"longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.",Pride and Prejudice,10794
1342,It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so,Pride and Prejudice,10795
1342,unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers,Pride and Prejudice,10796
1342,of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now,Pride and Prejudice,10797
1342,accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was,Pride and Prejudice,10798
1342,"not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible",Pride and Prejudice,10799
1342,"that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better",Pride and Prejudice,10800
1342,feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a,Pride and Prejudice,10801
1342,most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself,Pride and Prejudice,10802
1342,"and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it",Pride and Prejudice,10803
1342,was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had,Pride and Prejudice,10804

1342,"it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to",Pride and Prejudice,10814
1342,"announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,",Pride and Prejudice,10815
1342,and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the,Pride and Prejudice,10816

1342,"incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,",Pride and Prejudice,10818

1342,him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the,Pride and Prejudice,10827

1342,"by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she",Pride and Prejudice,10835
1342,"was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the",Pride and Prejudice,10836

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,10839
1342,Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while,Pride and Prejudice,10840
1342,Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings,Pride and Prejudice,10841
1342,"found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving",Pride and Prejudice,10842
1342,"the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins",Pride and Prejudice,10843
1342,"had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be",Pride and Prejudice,10844
1342,"happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two",Pride and Prejudice,10845
1342,"inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that",Pride and Prejudice,10846
1342,Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she,Pride and Prejudice,10847
1342,herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two,Pride and Prejudice,10848
1342,points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could,Pride and Prejudice,10849
1342,console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her,Pride and Prejudice,10850
1342,resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without,Pride and Prejudice,10851

1342,less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;,Pride and Prejudice,10863
1342,nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty,Pride and Prejudice,10864
1342,"and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a",Pride and Prejudice,10865

1342,"rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection",Pride and Prejudice,10890
1342,"of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was",Pride and Prejudice,10891

1342,"to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither",Pride and Prejudice,10893

1342,complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come,Pride and Prejudice,10902
1342,to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient,Pride and Prejudice,10903

1342,Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice,10913

1342,Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that,Pride and Prejudice,10917

1342,"dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its",Pride and Prejudice,10920

1342,"whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that",Pride and Prejudice,10950
1342,"they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself",Pride and Prejudice,10951

1342,"on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's",Pride and Prejudice,11317

1342,"from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference",Pride and Prejudice,11319

1342,"part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many",Pride and Prejudice,11328
1342,acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since,Pride and Prejudice,11329
1342,"the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher",Pride and Prejudice,11330

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,11333
1342,"Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by",Pride and Prejudice,11334

1342,of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute,Pride and Prejudice,11336
1342,"description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of",Pride and Prejudice,11337

1342,"reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and",Pride and Prejudice,11341
1342,was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam,Pride and Prejudice,11342

1342,"sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters",Pride and Prejudice,11443
1342,were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be,Pride and Prejudice,11444
1342,"curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would",Pride and Prejudice,11445
1342,"like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to",Pride and Prejudice,11446
1342,"be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte",Pride and Prejudice,11447

1342,"still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was",Pride and Prejudice,11495
1342,as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for,Pride and Prejudice,11496
1342,wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to,Pride and Prejudice,11497

1342,"return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I",Pride and Prejudice,11499
1342,"receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that",Pride and Prejudice,11500
1342,"she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not",Pride and Prejudice,11501
1342,"calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was",Pride and Prejudice,11502
1342,"in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was",Pride and Prejudice,11503
1342,"perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,",Pride and Prejudice,11504
1342,though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out,Pride and Prejudice,11505
1342,as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on,Pride and Prejudice,11506
1342,"her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting",Pride and Prejudice,11507
1342,"wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the",Pride and Prejudice,11508
1342,cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know,Pride and Prejudice,11509
1342,"this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily",Pride and Prejudice,11510
1342,account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to,Pride and Prejudice,11511
1342,"his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and",Pride and Prejudice,11512
1342,"amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,",Pride and Prejudice,11513
1342,"because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.",Pride and Prejudice,11514
1342,"He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said",Pride and Prejudice,11515

1342,wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I,Pride and Prejudice,11517
1342,"cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should",Pride and Prejudice,11518
1342,be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity,Pride and Prejudice,11519

1342,"Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied",Pride and Prejudice,11544
1342,"with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune",Pride and Prejudice,11545

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,11554
1342,All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the,Pride and Prejudice,11555

1342,"sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take",Pride and Prejudice,11578
1342,Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of,Pride and Prejudice,11579
1342,"going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan",Pride and Prejudice,11580
1342,and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure,Pride and Prejudice,11581
1342,as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing,Pride and Prejudice,11582
1342,"Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There",Pride and Prejudice,11583
1342,"was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such",Pride and Prejudice,11584
1342,"uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change",Pride and Prejudice,11585
1342,was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her,Pride and Prejudice,11586
1342,"a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have",Pride and Prejudice,11587
1342,"been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,",Pride and Prejudice,11588
1342,and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was,Pride and Prejudice,11589
1342,to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement,Pride and Prejudice,11590
1342,"of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became",Pride and Prejudice,11591
1342,perfect as plan could be.,Pride and Prejudice,11592

1342,"first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner",Pride and Prejudice,11601
1342,"of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of",Pride and Prejudice,11602

1342,"was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to",Pride and Prejudice,11605
1342,"him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,",Pride and Prejudice,11606

1342,"that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much",Pride and Prejudice,11613
1342,"delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but",Pride and Prejudice,11614
1342,she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of,Pride and Prejudice,11615
1342,the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were,Pride and Prejudice,11616

1342,"door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when",Pride and Prejudice,11621
1342,"they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,",Pride and Prejudice,11622
1342,"looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and",Pride and Prejudice,11623
1342,"lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,",Pride and Prejudice,11624
1342,whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to,Pride and Prejudice,11625
1342,"wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen",Pride and Prejudice,11626
1342,"her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and",Pride and Prejudice,11627
1342,kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and,Pride and Prejudice,11628
1342,"shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.",Pride and Prejudice,11629
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,11630

1342,"her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her",Pride and Prejudice,11633
1342,"spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,",Pride and Prejudice,11634
1342,to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the,Pride and Prejudice,11635

1342,everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte,Pride and Prejudice,11730

1342,"led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of",Pride and Prejudice,11732

1342,"neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they",Pride and Prejudice,11741
1342,"were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious",Pride and Prejudice,11742

1342,offers of refreshment.,Pride and Prejudice,11744

1342,"aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,",Pride and Prejudice,11748

1342,"though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to",Pride and Prejudice,11750
1342,"gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at",Pride and Prejudice,11751

1342,When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be,Pride and Prejudice,11753
1342,"ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her",Pride and Prejudice,11754
1342,eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but,Pride and Prejudice,11755
1342,in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to,Pride and Prejudice,11756
1342,"admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to",Pride and Prejudice,11757
1342,"the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had",Pride and Prejudice,11758
1342,"happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the",Pride and Prejudice,11759
1342,"garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of",Pride and Prejudice,11760
1342,which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most,Pride and Prejudice,11761
1342,respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance,Pride and Prejudice,11762
1342,"with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and",Pride and Prejudice,11763

1342,"through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an",Pride and Prejudice,11765
1342,"interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out",Pride and Prejudice,11766
1342,with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the,Pride and Prejudice,11767
1342,"fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in",Pride and Prejudice,11768
1342,"the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which",Pride and Prejudice,11769
1342,"the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the",Pride and Prejudice,11770
1342,"prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered",Pride and Prejudice,11771
1342,the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome,Pride and Prejudice,11772

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,11774

1342,gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered,Pride and Prejudice,12117
1342,round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were,Pride and Prejudice,12118
1342,to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by,Pride and Prejudice,12119
1342,the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.,Pride and Prejudice,12120
1342,Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon,Pride and Prejudice,12121
1342,"as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin",Pride and Prejudice,12122
1342,"to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for",Pride and Prejudice,12123
1342,"Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her",Pride and Prejudice,12124
1342,"commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy",Pride and Prejudice,12125
1342,"Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise",Pride and Prejudice,12126

1342,and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not,Pride and Prejudice,12136
1342,"often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his",Pride and Prejudice,12137
1342,"morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but",Pride and Prejudice,12138
1342,"when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,",Pride and Prejudice,12139
1342,and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her,Pride and Prejudice,12140
1342,"cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast",Pride and Prejudice,12141
1342,and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in,Pride and Prejudice,12142
1342,"reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,",Pride and Prejudice,12143
1342,which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.,Pride and Prejudice,12144
1342,Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer,Pride and Prejudice,12145
1342,"the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a",Pride and Prejudice,12146
1342,more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent,Pride and Prejudice,12147
1342,"reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been",Pride and Prejudice,12148
1342,"much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and",Pride and Prejudice,12149

1342,"which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened",Pride and Prejudice,12155
1342,"almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and",Pride and Prejudice,12156

1342,and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during,Pride and Prejudice,12165
1342,"these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,",Pride and Prejudice,12166
1342,and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement,Pride and Prejudice,12167
1342,of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she,Pride and Prejudice,12168
1342,"accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding",Pride and Prejudice,12169
1342,out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.,Pride and Prejudice,12170
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,12171

1342,by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to,Pride and Prejudice,12175

1342,"of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living",Pride and Prejudice,12183
1342,"in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,",Pride and Prejudice,12184
1342,"however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time",Pride and Prejudice,12185
1342,comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with,Pride and Prejudice,12186
1342,"Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had",Pride and Prejudice,12187
1342,"often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she",Pride and Prejudice,12188
1342,"frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was",Pride and Prejudice,12189
1342,"along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was",Pride and Prejudice,12190
1342,"a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and",Pride and Prejudice,12191
1342,where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.,Pride and Prejudice,12192
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,12193
1342,"In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.",Pride and Prejudice,12194

1342,"addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be",Pride and Prejudice,12196

1342,"expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not",Pride and Prejudice,12198
1342,"many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would",Pride and Prejudice,12199
1342,"furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and",Pride and Prejudice,12200
1342,she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him,Pride and Prejudice,12201
1342,"were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently",Pride and Prejudice,12202
1342,"destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest",Pride and Prejudice,12203
1342,"satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and",Pride and Prejudice,12204

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,12207
1342,His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking,Pride and Prejudice,12208
1342,"the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,",Pride and Prejudice,12209

1342,"bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great",Pride and Prejudice,12211
1342,intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his,Pride and Prejudice,12212
1342,"respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for",Pride and Prejudice,12213
1342,"Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of",Pride and Prejudice,12214
1342,"his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when",Pride and Prejudice,12215
1342,"Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen",Pride and Prejudice,12216
1342,"them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running",Pride and Prejudice,12217

1342,"used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual",Pride and Prejudice,12228
1342,"reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her",Pride and Prejudice,12229
1342,"friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely",Pride and Prejudice,12230
1342,curtseyed to him without saying a word.,Pride and Prejudice,12231
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,12232
1342,Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the,Pride and Prejudice,12233
1342,"readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but",Pride and Prejudice,12234
1342,"his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and",Pride and Prejudice,12235
1342,"garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.",Pride and Prejudice,12236
1342,"At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of",Pride and Prejudice,12237
1342,Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual,Pride and Prejudice,12238
1342,"way, and after a moment's pause, added:",Pride and Prejudice,12239
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,12240

1342,"the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he",Pride and Prejudice,12246
1342,answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The,Pride and Prejudice,12247

1342,received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the,Pride and Prejudice,12259

1342,"almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by",Pride and Prejudice,12261

1342,come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little,Pride and Prejudice,12263
1342,of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the,Pride and Prejudice,12264

1342,"talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying",Pride and Prejudice,12278
1342,"at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so",Pride and Prejudice,12279
1342,well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much,Pride and Prejudice,12280
1342,"spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,",Pride and Prejudice,12281
1342,as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned,Pride and Prejudice,12282
1342,"towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a",Pride and Prejudice,12283

1342,"the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable",Pride and Prejudice,12546
1342,from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there,Pride and Prejudice,12547
1342,"was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot",Pride and Prejudice,12548
1342,"always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the",Pride and Prejudice,12549
1342,"pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the",Pride and Prejudice,12550
1342,two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither,Pride and Prejudice,12551

1342,"separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their",Pride and Prejudice,12553
1342,aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he,Pride and Prejudice,12554
1342,"had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended",Pride and Prejudice,12555
1342,him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in,Pride and Prejudice,12556
1342,"being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her",Pride and Prejudice,12557

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,12561
1342,"But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult",Pride and Prejudice,12562

1342,"Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was",Pride and Prejudice,12568
1342,"generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told",Pride and Prejudice,12569

1342,"certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that",Pride and Prejudice,12574
1342,"look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often",Pride and Prejudice,12575

1342,raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her,Pride and Prejudice,12582

1342,"prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that",Pride and Prejudice,12601

1342,"not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,",Pride and Prejudice,12605

1342,"never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking",Pride and Prejudice,12607
1342,or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third,Pride and Prejudice,12608

1342,"her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her",Pride and Prejudice,12610
1342,opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of,Pride and Prejudice,12611
1342,"Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to",Pride and Prejudice,12612
1342,expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying,Pride and Prejudice,12613
1342,_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel,Pride and Prejudice,12614
1342,"Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must",Pride and Prejudice,12615
1342,mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed,Pride and Prejudice,12616

1342,"many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to",Pride and Prejudice,12937

1342,him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence,Pride and Prejudice,12953
1342,which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!,Pride and Prejudice,12954

1342,"half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,",Pride and Prejudice,13008
1342,was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of,Pride and Prejudice,13009
1342,marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for,Pride and Prejudice,13010
1342,so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of,Pride and Prejudice,13011
1342,all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying,Pride and Prejudice,13012
1342,"her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his",Pride and Prejudice,13013
1342,own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired,Pride and Prejudice,13014
1342,"unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable",Pride and Prejudice,13015
1342,pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to,Pride and Prejudice,13016
1342,"Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could",Pride and Prejudice,13017
1342,"not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.",Pride and Prejudice,13018
1342,"Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon",Pride and Prejudice,13019
1342,overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for,Pride and Prejudice,13020
1342,a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the,Pride and Prejudice,13021
1342,sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to,Pride and Prejudice,13022

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13028
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13029
1342,Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations,Pride and Prejudice,13030
1342,which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the,Pride and Prejudice,13031
1342,surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything,Pride and Prejudice,13032
1342,"else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after",Pride and Prejudice,13033
1342,"breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding",Pride and Prejudice,13034
1342,"directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's",Pride and Prejudice,13035
1342,"sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,",Pride and Prejudice,13036
1342,"she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The",Pride and Prejudice,13037
1342,"park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one",Pride and Prejudice,13038
1342,of the gates into the ground.,Pride and Prejudice,13039
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13040
1342,"After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was",Pride and Prejudice,13041
1342,"tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and",Pride and Prejudice,13042
1342,look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had,Pride and Prejudice,13043
1342,"made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the",Pride and Prejudice,13044
1342,"verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,",Pride and Prejudice,13045
1342,when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which,Pride and Prejudice,13046
1342,"edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.",Pride and Prejudice,13047
1342,"Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now",Pride and Prejudice,13048
1342,"near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced",Pride and Prejudice,13049
1342,"her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though",Pride and Prejudice,13050
1342,"in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the",Pride and Prejudice,13051
1342,"gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,",Pride and Prejudice,13052
1342,"which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,",Pride and Prejudice,13053
1342,"""I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.",Pride and Prejudice,13054
1342,"Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"" And then, with a",Pride and Prejudice,13055
1342,"slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.",Pride and Prejudice,13056
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13057
1342,"With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,",Pride and Prejudice,13058
1342,"Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,",Pride and Prejudice,13059
1342,"perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written",Pride and Prejudice,13060
1342,"quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise",Pride and Prejudice,13061
1342,"full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated",Pride and Prejudice,13062
1342,"from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--",Pride and Prejudice,13063
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13064
1342,"""Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension",Pride and Prejudice,13065
1342,of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those,Pride and Prejudice,13066
1342,offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any,Pride and Prejudice,13067
1342,"intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes",Pride and Prejudice,13068
1342,"which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the",Pride and Prejudice,13069
1342,"effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,",Pride and Prejudice,13070
1342,"should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written",Pride and Prejudice,13071
1342,"and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand",Pride and Prejudice,13072
1342,"your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I",Pride and Prejudice,13073
1342,demand it of your justice.,Pride and Prejudice,13074
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13075
1342,"""Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal",Pride and Prejudice,13076
1342,"magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,",Pride and Prejudice,13077
1342,"that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley",Pride and Prejudice,13078
1342,"from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various",Pride and Prejudice,13079
1342,"claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate",Pride and Prejudice,13080
1342,prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and,Pride and Prejudice,13081
1342,"wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged",Pride and Prejudice,13082
1342,"favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other",Pride and Prejudice,13083
1342,"dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect",Pride and Prejudice,13084
1342,"its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young",Pride and Prejudice,13085
1342,"persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could",Pride and Prejudice,13086
1342,bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last,Pride and Prejudice,13087
1342,"night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope",Pride and Prejudice,13088
1342,"to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions",Pride and Prejudice,13089
1342,"and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which",Pride and Prejudice,13090
1342,"is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which",Pride and Prejudice,13091
1342,"may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity",Pride and Prejudice,13092
1342,"must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.",Pride and Prejudice,13093
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13094
1342,"""I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with",Pride and Prejudice,13095
1342,"others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young",Pride and Prejudice,13096
1342,woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance,Pride and Prejudice,13097
1342,at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious,Pride and Prejudice,13098
1342,"attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I",Pride and Prejudice,13099
1342,"had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir",Pride and Prejudice,13100
1342,"William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to",Pride and Prejudice,13101
1342,your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.,Pride and Prejudice,13102
1342,"He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could",Pride and Prejudice,13103
1342,be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour,Pride and Prejudice,13104
1342,attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss,Pride and Prejudice,13105
1342,Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also,Pride and Prejudice,13106
1342,"watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,",Pride and Prejudice,13107
1342,"but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced",Pride and Prejudice,13108
1342,"from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions",Pride and Prejudice,13109
1342,"with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of",Pride and Prejudice,13110
1342,"sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been",Pride and Prejudice,13111
1342,in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter,Pride and Prejudice,13112
1342,"probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict",Pride and Prejudice,13113
1342,"pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not",Pride and Prejudice,13114
1342,"scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and",Pride and Prejudice,13115
1342,air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction,Pride and Prejudice,13116
1342,"that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be",Pride and Prejudice,13117
1342,easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is,Pride and Prejudice,13118
1342,certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions,Pride and Prejudice,13119
1342,are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe,Pride and Prejudice,13120
1342,her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial,Pride and Prejudice,13121
1342,"conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the",Pride and Prejudice,13122
1342,marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have,Pride and Prejudice,13123
1342,"the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of",Pride and Prejudice,13124
1342,connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But,Pride and Prejudice,13125
1342,"there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still",Pride and Prejudice,13126
1342,"existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had",Pride and Prejudice,13127
1342,"myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before",Pride and Prejudice,13128
1342,"me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your",Pride and Prejudice,13129
1342,"mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that",Pride and Prejudice,13130
1342,"total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by",Pride and Prejudice,13131
1342,"herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your",Pride and Prejudice,13132
1342,father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern,Pride and Prejudice,13133
1342,"for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this",Pride and Prejudice,13134
1342,"representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to",Pride and Prejudice,13135
1342,"have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,",Pride and Prejudice,13136
1342,"is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than",Pride and Prejudice,13137
1342,it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say,Pride and Prejudice,13138
1342,"farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties",Pride and Prejudice,13139
1342,"was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led",Pride and Prejudice,13140
1342,"me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy",Pride and Prejudice,13141
1342,"connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as",Pride and Prejudice,13142
1342,"you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.",Pride and Prejudice,13143
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13144
1342,"""The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness",Pride and Prejudice,13145
1342,had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was,Pride and Prejudice,13146
1342,"soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in",Pride and Prejudice,13147
1342,"detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in",Pride and Prejudice,13148
1342,London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office,Pride and Prejudice,13149
1342,of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I,Pride and Prejudice,13150
1342,"described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance",Pride and Prejudice,13151
1342,"might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose",Pride and Prejudice,13152
1342,"that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been",Pride and Prejudice,13153
1342,"seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your",Pride and Prejudice,13154
1342,sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his,Pride and Prejudice,13155
1342,"affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great",Pride and Prejudice,13156
1342,"natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his",Pride and Prejudice,13157
1342,"own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was",Pride and Prejudice,13158
1342,no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into,Pride and Prejudice,13159
1342,"Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the",Pride and Prejudice,13160
1342,work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There,Pride and Prejudice,13161
1342,is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not,Pride and Prejudice,13162
1342,reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the,Pride and Prejudice,13163
1342,measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in,Pride and Prejudice,13164
1342,"town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her",Pride and Prejudice,13165
1342,brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without,Pride and Prejudice,13166
1342,ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me,Pride and Prejudice,13167
1342,enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this,Pride and Prejudice,13168
1342,"concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it",Pride and Prejudice,13169
1342,"was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no",Pride and Prejudice,13170
1342,"other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it",Pride and Prejudice,13171
1342,was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to,Pride and Prejudice,13172
1342,"you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn",Pride and Prejudice,13173

1342,"school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his",Pride and Prejudice,13187
1342,"own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have",Pride and Prejudice,13188
1342,been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only,Pride and Prejudice,13189
1342,"fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he",Pride and Prejudice,13190
1342,"had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be",Pride and Prejudice,13191
1342,"his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is",Pride and Prejudice,13192
1342,"many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different",Pride and Prejudice,13193
1342,"manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was",Pride and Prejudice,13194
1342,"careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape",Pride and Prejudice,13195
1342,"the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,",Pride and Prejudice,13196
1342,"and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.",Pride and Prejudice,13197
1342,Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree,Pride and Prejudice,13198
1342,you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham,Pride and Prejudice,13199
1342,"has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from",Pride and Prejudice,13200
1342,unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.,Pride and Prejudice,13201
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13202
1342,"""My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to",Pride and Prejudice,13203
1342,"Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly",Pride and Prejudice,13204
1342,"recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner",Pride and Prejudice,13205
1342,"that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a",Pride and Prejudice,13206
1342,valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There,Pride and Prejudice,13207
1342,was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long,Pride and Prejudice,13208
1342,"survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham",Pride and Prejudice,13209
1342,"wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,",Pride and Prejudice,13210
1342,he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more,Pride and Prejudice,13211
1342,"immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he",Pride and Prejudice,13212
1342,"could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying",Pride and Prejudice,13213
1342,"law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would",Pride and Prejudice,13214
1342,"be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed",Pride and Prejudice,13215
1342,"him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to",Pride and Prejudice,13216
1342,his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the,Pride and Prejudice,13217
1342,business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance,Pride and Prejudice,13218
1342,"in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to",Pride and Prejudice,13219
1342,"receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection",Pride and Prejudice,13220
1342,between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him,Pride and Prejudice,13221
1342,"to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly",Pride and Prejudice,13222
1342,"lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free",Pride and Prejudice,13223
1342,"from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.",Pride and Prejudice,13224
1342,For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the,Pride and Prejudice,13225
1342,"incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to",Pride and Prejudice,13226
1342,"me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured",Pride and Prejudice,13227
1342,"me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He",Pride and Prejudice,13228
1342,"had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely",Pride and Prejudice,13229
1342,"resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in",Pride and Prejudice,13230
1342,"question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was",Pride and Prejudice,13231
1342,"well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not",Pride and Prejudice,13232
1342,have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame,Pride and Prejudice,13233
1342,"me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every",Pride and Prejudice,13234
1342,repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of,Pride and Prejudice,13235
1342,his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me,Pride and Prejudice,13236
1342,to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every,Pride and Prejudice,13237
1342,appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But,Pride and Prejudice,13238
1342,last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.,Pride and Prejudice,13239
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13240
1342,"""I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,",Pride and Prejudice,13241
1342,and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold,Pride and Prejudice,13242
1342,"to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your",Pride and Prejudice,13243
1342,"secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to",Pride and Prejudice,13244
1342,"the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.",Pride and Prejudice,13245
1342,"About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed",Pride and Prejudice,13246
1342,for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided,Pride and Prejudice,13247
1342,"over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by",Pride and Prejudice,13248
1342,design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him,Pride and Prejudice,13249
1342,"and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and",Pride and Prejudice,13250
1342,"by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,",Pride and Prejudice,13251
1342,whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to,Pride and Prejudice,13252
1342,"her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and",Pride and Prejudice,13253
1342,"to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her",Pride and Prejudice,13254
1342,"excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed",Pride and Prejudice,13255
1342,the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two,Pride and Prejudice,13256
1342,"before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the",Pride and Prejudice,13257
1342,idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as,Pride and Prejudice,13258
1342,"a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and",Pride and Prejudice,13259
1342,how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented,Pride and Prejudice,13260
1342,"any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place",Pride and Prejudice,13261
1342,"immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.",Pride and Prejudice,13262
1342,"Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which",Pride and Prejudice,13263
1342,is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of,Pride and Prejudice,13264
1342,revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have,Pride and Prejudice,13265
1342,been complete indeed.,Pride and Prejudice,13266
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13267
1342,"""This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have",Pride and Prejudice,13268
1342,been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as,Pride and Prejudice,13269

1342,"Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he",Pride and Prejudice,13271

1342,I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to,Pride and Prejudice,13278
1342,"be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more",Pride and Prejudice,13279
1342,"particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our",Pride and Prejudice,13280
1342,"near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of",Pride and Prejudice,13281
1342,"the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted",Pride and Prejudice,13282
1342,with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_,Pride and Prejudice,13283

1342,"contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of",Pride and Prejudice,13298
1342,"its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly",Pride and Prejudice,13299
1342,"she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.",Pride and Prejudice,13300
1342,Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did,Pride and Prejudice,13301
1342,she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;,Pride and Prejudice,13302
1342,"and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation",Pride and Prejudice,13303
1342,"to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong",Pride and Prejudice,13304
1342,"prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what",Pride and Prejudice,13305
1342,had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly,Pride and Prejudice,13306
1342,"left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the",Pride and Prejudice,13307
1342,"next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of",Pride and Prejudice,13308
1342,the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she,Pride and Prejudice,13309
1342,"instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst",Pride and Prejudice,13310
1342,"objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing",Pride and Prejudice,13311
1342,him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied,Pride and Prejudice,13312
1342,"her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and",Pride and Prejudice,13313
1342,insolence.,Pride and Prejudice,13314
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13315
1342,But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when,Pride and Prejudice,13316
1342,"she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,",Pride and Prejudice,13317
1342,"if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which",Pride and Prejudice,13318
1342,bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her,Pride and Prejudice,13319
1342,feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.,Pride and Prejudice,13320
1342,"Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished",Pride and Prejudice,13321
1342,"to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, ""This must be false!",Pride and Prejudice,13322
1342,"This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!""--and when she had",Pride and Prejudice,13323
1342,"gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the",Pride and Prejudice,13324
1342,"last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not",Pride and Prejudice,13325
1342,"regard it, that she would never look in it again.",Pride and Prejudice,13326
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13327
1342,"In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on",Pride and Prejudice,13328
1342,"nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter",Pride and Prejudice,13329
1342,"was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she",Pride and Prejudice,13330
1342,"again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and",Pride and Prejudice,13331
1342,commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.,Pride and Prejudice,13332
1342,The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what,Pride and Prejudice,13333
1342,"he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though",Pride and Prejudice,13334
1342,"she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own",Pride and Prejudice,13335
1342,words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the,Pride and Prejudice,13336
1342,"will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living",Pride and Prejudice,13337
1342,"was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was",Pride and Prejudice,13338
1342,impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the,Pride and Prejudice,13339
1342,"other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did",Pride and Prejudice,13340
1342,"not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the",Pride and Prejudice,13341
1342,particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions,Pride and Prejudice,13342
1342,"to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three",Pride and Prejudice,13343
1342,"thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down",Pride and Prejudice,13344
1342,"the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be",Pride and Prejudice,13345
1342,impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with,Pride and Prejudice,13346
1342,little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read,Pride and Prejudice,13347
1342,"on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had",Pride and Prejudice,13348
1342,believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to,Pride and Prejudice,13349
1342,"render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a",Pride and Prejudice,13350
1342,turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.,Pride and Prejudice,13351
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13352
1342,The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at,Pride and Prejudice,13353
1342,"Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could",Pride and Prejudice,13354
1342,bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his,Pride and Prejudice,13355
1342,"entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the",Pride and Prejudice,13356
1342,"persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,",Pride and Prejudice,13357
1342,had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,Pride and Prejudice,13358
1342,nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As,Pride and Prejudice,13359
1342,"to his real character, had information been in her power, she had",Pride and Prejudice,13360
1342,"never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had",Pride and Prejudice,13361
1342,established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried,Pride and Prejudice,13362
1342,"to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of",Pride and Prejudice,13363
1342,"integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of",Pride and Prejudice,13364
1342,"Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those",Pride and Prejudice,13365
1342,casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy,Pride and Prejudice,13366
1342,had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But,Pride and Prejudice,13367
1342,no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before,Pride and Prejudice,13368
1342,"her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more",Pride and Prejudice,13369
1342,"substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and",Pride and Prejudice,13370
1342,the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After,Pride and Prejudice,13371
1342,"pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to",Pride and Prejudice,13372
1342,"read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss",Pride and Prejudice,13373
1342,"Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel",Pride and Prejudice,13374
1342,Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was,Pride and Prejudice,13375
1342,referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam,Pride and Prejudice,13376
1342,himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his,Pride and Prejudice,13377
1342,"near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no",Pride and Prejudice,13378
1342,reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to,Pride and Prejudice,13379
1342,"him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and",Pride and Prejudice,13380
1342,at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never,Pride and Prejudice,13381
1342,"have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his",Pride and Prejudice,13382
1342,cousin's corroboration.,Pride and Prejudice,13383
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13384
1342,She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation,Pride and Prejudice,13385
1342,"between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.",Pride and Prejudice,13386
1342,Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_,Pride and Prejudice,13387
1342,"struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and",Pride and Prejudice,13388
1342,wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting,Pride and Prejudice,13389
1342,"himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions",Pride and Prejudice,13390
1342,with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear,Pride and Prejudice,13391
1342,"of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that",Pride and Prejudice,13392
1342,_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball,Pride and Prejudice,13393
1342,"the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield",Pride and Prejudice,13394
1342,"family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but",Pride and Prejudice,13395
1342,herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;,Pride and Prejudice,13396
1342,"that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's",Pride and Prejudice,13397
1342,"character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would",Pride and Prejudice,13398
1342,always prevent his exposing the son.,Pride and Prejudice,13399
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,13400
1342,How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!,Pride and Prejudice,13401
1342,His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and,Pride and Prejudice,13402
1342,hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer,Pride and Prejudice,13403
1342,"the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.",Pride and Prejudice,13404
1342,His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had,Pride and Prejudice,13405
1342,"either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying",Pride and Prejudice,13406
1342,his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most,Pride and Prejudice,13407
1342,incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter,Pride and Prejudice,13408
1342,"and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not",Pride and Prejudice,13409
1342,"but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago",Pride and Prejudice,13410
1342,asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as,Pride and Prejudice,13411
1342,"were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their",Pride and Prejudice,13412
1342,acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much,Pride and Prejudice,13413
1342,"together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything",Pride and Prejudice,13414
1342,that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him,Pride and Prejudice,13415
1342,of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was,Pride and Prejudice,13416
1342,esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a,Pride and Prejudice,13417
1342,"brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his",Pride and Prejudice,13418
1342,sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his,Pride and Prejudice,13419

1342,sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around,Pride and Prejudice,14380

1342,for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother,Pride and Prejudice,14395

1342,"that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the",Pride and Prejudice,14509

1342,"Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid",Pride and Prejudice,14512

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14530
1342,"The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They",Pride and Prejudice,14531
1342,"entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through",Pride and Prejudice,14532
1342,a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.,Pride and Prejudice,14533
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14534

1342,"half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable",Pride and Prejudice,14537
1342,"eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by",Pride and Prejudice,14538
1342,"Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which",Pride and Prejudice,14539
1342,"the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone",Pride and Prejudice,14540
1342,"building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of",Pride and Prejudice,14541
1342,"high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was",Pride and Prejudice,14542
1342,"swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks",Pride and Prejudice,14543
1342,were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She,Pride and Prejudice,14544
1342,"had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural",Pride and Prejudice,14545
1342,beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were,Pride and Prejudice,14546
1342,all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that,Pride and Prejudice,14547
1342,to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!,Pride and Prejudice,14548
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14549

1342,"while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of",Pride and Prejudice,14551
1342,meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been,Pride and Prejudice,14552
1342,"mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the",Pride and Prejudice,14553
1342,"hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to",Pride and Prejudice,14554
1342,wonder at her being where she was.,Pride and Prejudice,14555
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14556
1342,"The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less",Pride and Prejudice,14557
1342,"fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They",Pride and Prejudice,14558
1342,"followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned",Pride and Prejudice,14559
1342,"room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went",Pride and Prejudice,14560
1342,"to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which",Pride and Prejudice,14561
1342,"they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,",Pride and Prejudice,14562
1342,was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and,Pride and Prejudice,14563

1342,"banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,",Pride and Prejudice,14565
1342,with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking,Pride and Prejudice,14566
1342,different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be,Pride and Prejudice,14567
1342,"seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to",Pride and Prejudice,14568
1342,"the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of",Pride and Prejudice,14569

1342,"impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few",Pride and Prejudice,14781
1342,minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in,Pride and Prejudice,14782
1342,"her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent",Pride and Prejudice,14783
1342,had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as,Pride and Prejudice,14784
1342,"to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in",Pride and Prejudice,14785
1342,"Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the",Pride and Prejudice,14786
1342,distraction of his thoughts.,Pride and Prejudice,14787
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14788
1342,"At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few",Pride and Prejudice,14789
1342,"moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took",Pride and Prejudice,14790
1342,leave.,Pride and Prejudice,14791
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14792
1342,"The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but",Pride and Prejudice,14793
1342,"Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,",Pride and Prejudice,14794
1342,followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her,Pride and Prejudice,14795
1342,"coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the",Pride and Prejudice,14796
1342,world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light,Pride and Prejudice,14797
1342,might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely,Pride and Prejudice,14798
1342,"thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he",Pride and Prejudice,14799
1342,thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes,Pride and Prejudice,14800
1342,"sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;",Pride and Prejudice,14801
1342,for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted,Pride and Prejudice,14802
1342,from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over,Pride and Prejudice,14803
1342,"the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly",Pride and Prejudice,14804
1342,altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was,Pride and Prejudice,14805
1342,"amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!",Pride and Prejudice,14806
1342,"Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never",Pride and Prejudice,14807
1342,had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What,Pride and Prejudice,14808
1342,"a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put",Pride and Prejudice,14809
1342,"his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account",Pride and Prejudice,14810
1342,for it.,Pride and Prejudice,14811
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14812
1342,"They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and",Pride and Prejudice,14813
1342,"every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer",Pride and Prejudice,14814
1342,reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time,Pride and Prejudice,14815
1342,"before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered",Pride and Prejudice,14816
1342,"mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and",Pride and Prejudice,14817
1342,"seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she",Pride and Prejudice,14818
1342,distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that,Pride and Prejudice,14819
1342,"one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then",Pride and Prejudice,14820
1342,was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in,Pride and Prejudice,14821
1342,"what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,",Pride and Prejudice,14822
1342,she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he,Pride and Prejudice,14823
1342,felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was,Pride and Prejudice,14824
1342,not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in,Pride and Prejudice,14825
1342,"seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with",Pride and Prejudice,14826
1342,composure.,Pride and Prejudice,14827
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14828
1342,"At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind",Pride and Prejudice,14829
1342,"aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.",Pride and Prejudice,14830
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14831
1342,"They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,",Pride and Prejudice,14832
1342,"ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of",Pride and Prejudice,14833
1342,"the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the",Pride and Prejudice,14834
1342,"valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading",Pride and Prejudice,14835
1342,"many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish",Pride and Prejudice,14836
1342,"of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.",Pride and Prejudice,14837
1342,With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.,Pride and Prejudice,14838
1342,It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which,Pride and Prejudice,14839
1342,"brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,",Pride and Prejudice,14840
1342,"to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed",Pride and Prejudice,14841
1342,"it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;",Pride and Prejudice,14842
1342,it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the,Pride and Prejudice,14843
1342,"valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,",Pride and Prejudice,14844
1342,and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.,Pride and Prejudice,14845
1342,Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the,Pride and Prejudice,14846
1342,"bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,",Pride and Prejudice,14847
1342,"who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only",Pride and Prejudice,14848
1342,"of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,",Pride and Prejudice,14849
1342,"therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house",Pride and Prejudice,14850
1342,"on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their",Pride and Prejudice,14851
1342,"progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the",Pride and Prejudice,14852
1342,"taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the",Pride and Prejudice,14853
1342,"occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the",Pride and Prejudice,14854
1342,"man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this",Pride and Prejudice,14855
1342,"slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment",Pride and Prejudice,14856
1342,"was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy",Pride and Prejudice,14857
1342,"approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here",Pride and Prejudice,14858
1342,"less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before",Pride and Prejudice,14859
1342,"they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared",Pride and Prejudice,14860
1342,"for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with",Pride and Prejudice,14861
1342,"calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,",Pride and Prejudice,14862
1342,she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea,Pride and Prejudice,14863
1342,lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the,Pride and Prejudice,14864
1342,"turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw",Pride and Prejudice,14865
1342,"that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his",Pride and Prejudice,14866
1342,"politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;",Pride and Prejudice,14867
1342,"but she had not got beyond the words ""delightful,"" and ""charming,"" when",Pride and Prejudice,14868
1342,"some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of",Pride and Prejudice,14869
1342,"Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,",Pride and Prejudice,14870
1342,and she said no more.,Pride and Prejudice,14871
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14872
1342,"Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked",Pride and Prejudice,14873
1342,her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.,Pride and Prejudice,14874
1342,This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;,Pride and Prejudice,14875
1342,and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the,Pride and Prejudice,14876
1342,acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had,Pride and Prejudice,14877
1342,"revolted in his offer to herself. ""What will be his surprise,"" thought",Pride and Prejudice,14878
1342,"she, ""when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of",Pride and Prejudice,14879
1342,"fashion.""",Pride and Prejudice,14880
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14881
1342,"The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their",Pride and Prejudice,14882
1342,"relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore",Pride and Prejudice,14883
1342,"it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he",Pride and Prejudice,14884
1342,could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the,Pride and Prejudice,14885
1342,"connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and",Pride and Prejudice,14886
1342,"so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into",Pride and Prejudice,14887
1342,"conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,",Pride and Prejudice,14888
1342,could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had,Pride and Prejudice,14889
1342,some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most,Pride and Prejudice,14890
1342,"attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every",Pride and Prejudice,14891
1342,"expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,",Pride and Prejudice,14892
1342,"his taste, or his good manners.",Pride and Prejudice,14893
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14894
1342,The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy,Pride and Prejudice,14895
1342,"invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he",Pride and Prejudice,14896
1342,"chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time",Pride and Prejudice,14897
1342,"to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of",Pride and Prejudice,14898
1342,"the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was",Pride and Prejudice,14899
1342,"walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.",Pride and Prejudice,14900
1342,"Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment",Pride and Prejudice,14901
1342,"must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and",Pride and Prejudice,14902
1342,"continually was she repeating, ""Why is he so altered? From what can",Pride and Prejudice,14903
1342,it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his,Pride and Prejudice,14904
1342,manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a,Pride and Prejudice,14905
1342,"change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.""",Pride and Prejudice,14906
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14907
1342,"After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two",Pride and Prejudice,14908
1342,"gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to",Pride and Prejudice,14909
1342,the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious,Pride and Prejudice,14910
1342,"water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated",Pride and Prejudice,14911
1342,"in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found",Pride and Prejudice,14912
1342,"Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred",Pride and Prejudice,14913
1342,"her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on",Pride and Prejudice,14914
1342,"together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him",Pride and Prejudice,14915
1342,to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the,Pride and Prejudice,14916
1342,"place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been",Pride and Prejudice,14917
1342,"very unexpected--""for your housekeeper,"" she added, ""informed us that",Pride and Prejudice,14918
1342,"you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we",Pride and Prejudice,14919
1342,"left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected",Pride and Prejudice,14920
1342,"in the country."" He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that",Pride and Prejudice,14921
1342,business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours,Pride and Prejudice,14922
1342,"before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. ""They",Pride and Prejudice,14923
1342,"will join me early to-morrow,"" he continued, ""and among them are some",Pride and Prejudice,14924
1342,"who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.""",Pride and Prejudice,14925
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14926
1342,Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly,Pride and Prejudice,14927
1342,driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last,Pride and Prejudice,14928
1342,"mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_",Pride and Prejudice,14929
1342,mind was not very differently engaged.,Pride and Prejudice,14930
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14931
1342,"""There is also one other person in the party,"" he continued after a",Pride and Prejudice,14932
1342,"pause, ""who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow",Pride and Prejudice,14933
1342,"me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance",Pride and Prejudice,14934
1342,"during your stay at Lambton?""",Pride and Prejudice,14935
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14936
1342,The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great,Pride and Prejudice,14937
1342,for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt,Pride and Prejudice,14938
1342,that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,Pride and Prejudice,14939
1342,"must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was",Pride and Prejudice,14940
1342,satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made,Pride and Prejudice,14941
1342,him think really ill of her.,Pride and Prejudice,14942
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14943
1342,"They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth",Pride and Prejudice,14944
1342,was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and,Pride and Prejudice,14945
1342,pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of,Pride and Prejudice,14946
1342,"the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had",Pride and Prejudice,14947
1342,"reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a",Pride and Prejudice,14948
1342,mile behind.,Pride and Prejudice,14949
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14950
1342,He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not,Pride and Prejudice,14951
1342,"tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might",Pride and Prejudice,14952
1342,"have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but",Pride and Prejudice,14953
1342,there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected,Pride and Prejudice,14954
1342,"that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale",Pride and Prejudice,14955
1342,with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her,Pride and Prejudice,14956
1342,patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was,Pride and Prejudice,14957
1342,over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go,Pride and Prejudice,14958
1342,"into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and",Pride and Prejudice,14959
1342,they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the,Pride and Prejudice,14960
1342,"ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him",Pride and Prejudice,14961
1342,walking slowly towards the house.,Pride and Prejudice,14962
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14963
1342,The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them,Pride and Prejudice,14964
1342,pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.,Pride and Prejudice,14965
1342,"""He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,"" said her uncle.",Pride and Prejudice,14966
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14967
1342,"""There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,"" replied her",Pride and Prejudice,14968
1342,"aunt, ""but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now",Pride and Prejudice,14969
1342,"say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I",Pride and Prejudice,14970
1342,"have seen nothing of it.""",Pride and Prejudice,14971
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14972
1342,"""I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more",Pride and Prejudice,14973
1342,than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such,Pride and Prejudice,14974
1342,"attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.""",Pride and Prejudice,14975
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14976
1342,"""To be sure, Lizzy,"" said her aunt, ""he is not so handsome as Wickham;",Pride and Prejudice,14977
1342,"or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features",Pride and Prejudice,14978
1342,are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so,Pride and Prejudice,14979
1342,"disagreeable?""",Pride and Prejudice,14980
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14981
1342,Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked,Pride and Prejudice,14982
1342,"him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never",Pride and Prejudice,14983
1342,seen him so pleasant as this morning.,Pride and Prejudice,14984
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14985
1342,"""But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,"" replied",Pride and Prejudice,14986
1342,"her uncle. ""Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him",Pride and Prejudice,14987
1342,"at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off",Pride and Prejudice,14988
1342,"his grounds.""",Pride and Prejudice,14989
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14990
1342,"Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but",Pride and Prejudice,14991
1342,said nothing.,Pride and Prejudice,14992
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,14993
1342,"""From what we have seen of him,"" continued Mrs. Gardiner, ""I really",Pride and Prejudice,14994
1342,should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by,Pride and Prejudice,14995
1342,anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.,Pride and Prejudice,14996
1342,"On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he",Pride and Prejudice,14997
1342,speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would,Pride and Prejudice,14998
1342,"not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the",Pride and Prejudice,14999
1342,good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!,Pride and Prejudice,15000
1342,I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal,Pride and Prejudice,15001
1342,"master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every",Pride and Prejudice,15002
1342,"virtue.""",Pride and Prejudice,15003
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15004
1342,Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of,Pride and Prejudice,15005
1342,"his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in",Pride and Prejudice,15006
1342,"as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from",Pride and Prejudice,15007
1342,"his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different",Pride and Prejudice,15008
1342,"construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor",Pride and Prejudice,15009
1342,"Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In",Pride and Prejudice,15010
1342,"confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary",Pride and Prejudice,15011
1342,"transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming",Pride and Prejudice,15012
1342,"her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.",Pride and Prejudice,15013
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15014
1342,Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now,Pride and Prejudice,15015
1342,"approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to",Pride and Prejudice,15016
1342,the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out,Pride and Prejudice,15017
1342,to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of,Pride and Prejudice,15018
1342,anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they,Pride and Prejudice,15019
1342,had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former,Pride and Prejudice,15020
1342,"acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a",Pride and Prejudice,15021

1342,"to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a",Pride and Prejudice,15040
1342,"carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in",Pride and Prejudice,15041
1342,a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing,Pride and Prejudice,15042
1342,"the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her",Pride and Prejudice,15043
1342,surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she,Pride and Prejudice,15044
1342,expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment,Pride and Prejudice,15045
1342,"of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many",Pride and Prejudice,15046
1342,"of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on",Pride and Prejudice,15047
1342,"the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that",Pride and Prejudice,15048
1342,there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a,Pride and Prejudice,15049
1342,quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these,Pride and Prejudice,15050
1342,"newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of",Pride and Prejudice,15051
1342,Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite,Pride and Prejudice,15052
1342,"amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,",Pride and Prejudice,15053
1342,she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much,Pride and Prejudice,15054
1342,"in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally",Pride and Prejudice,15055
1342,suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.,Pride and Prejudice,15056
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15057
1342,"She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked",Pride and Prejudice,15058
1342,"up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of",Pride and Prejudice,15059
1342,inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.,Pride and Prejudice,15060
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15061
1342,"Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction",Pride and Prejudice,15062
1342,took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new,Pride and Prejudice,15063
1342,acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her,Pride and Prejudice,15064
1342,"being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;",Pride and Prejudice,15065
1342,but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was,Pride and Prejudice,15066
1342,only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from,Pride and Prejudice,15067
1342,her beyond a monosyllable.,Pride and Prejudice,15068
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15069
1342,"Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though",Pride and Prejudice,15070
1342,"little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance",Pride and Prejudice,15071
1342,womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there,Pride and Prejudice,15072
1342,"was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly",Pride and Prejudice,15073
1342,"unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as",Pride and Prejudice,15074
1342,"acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much",Pride and Prejudice,15075
1342,relieved by discerning such different feelings.,Pride and Prejudice,15076
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15077
1342,They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley,Pride and Prejudice,15078
1342,was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her,Pride and Prejudice,15079
1342,"satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick",Pride and Prejudice,15080
1342,"step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All",Pride and Prejudice,15081
1342,Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still,Pride and Prejudice,15082
1342,"felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected",Pride and Prejudice,15083
1342,cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He,Pride and Prejudice,15084
1342,"inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked",Pride and Prejudice,15085
1342,and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.,Pride and Prejudice,15086
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15087
1342,To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage,Pride and Prejudice,15088
1342,than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before,Pride and Prejudice,15089
1342,"them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just",Pride and Prejudice,15090
1342,arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards,Pride and Prejudice,15091
1342,each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from,Pride and Prejudice,15092
1342,those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew,Pride and Prejudice,15093
1342,what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little,Pride and Prejudice,15094
1342,in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was,Pride and Prejudice,15095
1342,evident enough.,Pride and Prejudice,15096
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15097
1342,"Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the",Pride and Prejudice,15098
1342,"feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and",Pride and Prejudice,15099
1342,"to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she",Pride and Prejudice,15100
1342,"feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she",Pride and Prejudice,15101
1342,endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley,Pride and Prejudice,15102
1342,"was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.",Pride and Prejudice,15103
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15104
1342,"In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!",Pride and Prejudice,15105
1342,how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in,Pride and Prejudice,15106
1342,a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on,Pride and Prejudice,15107
1342,"former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion",Pride and Prejudice,15108
1342,"that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,",Pride and Prejudice,15109
1342,"though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his",Pride and Prejudice,15110
1342,"behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look",Pride and Prejudice,15111
1342,appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred,Pride and Prejudice,15112
1342,between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point,Pride and Prejudice,15113
1342,she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred,Pride and Prejudice,15114
1342,"ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a",Pride and Prejudice,15115
1342,"recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying",Pride and Prejudice,15116
1342,"more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed",Pride and Prejudice,15117
1342,"to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone",Pride and Prejudice,15118
1342,"which had something of real regret, that it ""was a very long time since",Pride and Prejudice,15119
1342,"he had had the pleasure of seeing her;"" and, before she could reply,",Pride and Prejudice,15120
1342,"he added, ""It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of",Pride and Prejudice,15121
1342,"November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.""",Pride and Prejudice,15122
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15123
1342,Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards,Pride and Prejudice,15124
1342,"took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether",Pride and Prejudice,15125
1342,"_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,",Pride and Prejudice,15126
1342,nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which,Pride and Prejudice,15127
1342,gave them meaning.,Pride and Prejudice,15128
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15129
1342,It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;,Pride and Prejudice,15130
1342,"but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general",Pride and Prejudice,15131
1342,"complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed",Pride and Prejudice,15132
1342,"from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that",Pride and Prejudice,15133
1342,the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however,Pride and Prejudice,15134
1342,"temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When",Pride and Prejudice,15135
1342,she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion,Pride and Prejudice,15136
1342,of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a,Pride and Prejudice,15137
1342,"disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the",Pride and Prejudice,15138
1342,"very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last",Pride and Prejudice,15139
1342,"lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was",Pride and Prejudice,15140
1342,"so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly",Pride and Prejudice,15141
1342,"restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company",Pride and Prejudice,15142
1342,"of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations",Pride and Prejudice,15143
1342,"at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from",Pride and Prejudice,15144
1342,"self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance",Pride and Prejudice,15145
1342,"could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the",Pride and Prejudice,15146
1342,acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw,Pride and Prejudice,15147
1342,down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and,Pride and Prejudice,15148
1342,Rosings.,Pride and Prejudice,15149
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15150
1342,Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose,Pride and Prejudice,15151
1342,"to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing",Pride and Prejudice,15152
1342,"their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner",Pride and Prejudice,15153
1342,"at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a",Pride and Prejudice,15154
1342,"diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,",Pride and Prejudice,15155
1342,"readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing",Pride and Prejudice,15156
1342,"how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its",Pride and Prejudice,15157
1342,"acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,",Pride and Prejudice,15158
1342,that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than,Pride and Prejudice,15159
1342,"any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of",Pride and Prejudice,15160
1342,"society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for",Pride and Prejudice,15161
1342,"her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.",Pride and Prejudice,15162
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15163
1342,Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice,15164
1342,"again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to",Pride and Prejudice,15165
1342,"make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all",Pride and Prejudice,15166
1342,"this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on",Pride and Prejudice,15167
1342,"this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their",Pride and Prejudice,15168
1342,"visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some",Pride and Prejudice,15169
1342,"satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been",Pride and Prejudice,15170
1342,"little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her",Pride and Prejudice,15171
1342,"uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their",Pride and Prejudice,15172
1342,"favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.",Pride and Prejudice,15173
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15174
1342,But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was,Pride and Prejudice,15175
1342,not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was,Pride and Prejudice,15176
1342,much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;,Pride and Prejudice,15177
1342,it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to,Pride and Prejudice,15178
1342,"interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.",Pride and Prejudice,15179
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15180
1342,"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far",Pride and Prejudice,15181
1342,"as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could",Pride and Prejudice,15182
1342,not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character,Pride and Prejudice,15183
1342,"from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference",Pride and Prejudice,15184
1342,"to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known",Pride and Prejudice,15185
1342,"would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,",Pride and Prejudice,15186
1342,"however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible",Pride and Prejudice,15187
1342,that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four,Pride and Prejudice,15188
1342,"years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be",Pride and Prejudice,15189
1342,hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of,Pride and Prejudice,15190
1342,their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had,Pride and Prejudice,15191
1342,"nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,",Pride and Prejudice,15192
1342,it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town,Pride and Prejudice,15193
1342,"where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he",Pride and Prejudice,15194
1342,"was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.",Pride and Prejudice,15195
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15196
1342,"With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held",Pride and Prejudice,15197
1342,there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the,Pride and Prejudice,15198
1342,"son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known",Pride and Prejudice,15199
1342,"fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind",Pride and Prejudice,15200
1342,"him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.",Pride and Prejudice,15201
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15202
1342,"As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than",Pride and Prejudice,15203
1342,"the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not",Pride and Prejudice,15204
1342,long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;,Pride and Prejudice,15205
1342,and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She,Pride and Prejudice,15206
1342,"certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she",Pride and Prejudice,15207
1342,"had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,",Pride and Prejudice,15208
1342,that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his,Pride and Prejudice,15209
1342,"valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some",Pride and Prejudice,15210
1342,time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened,Pride and Prejudice,15211
1342,"into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in",Pride and Prejudice,15212
1342,"his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,",Pride and Prejudice,15213
1342,"which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,",Pride and Prejudice,15214
1342,there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.,Pride and Prejudice,15215
1342,"It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,",Pride and Prejudice,15216
1342,but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and,Pride and Prejudice,15217
1342,"acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations",Pride and Prejudice,15218
1342,"accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid",Pride and Prejudice,15219
1342,"her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most",Pride and Prejudice,15220
1342,"eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display",Pride and Prejudice,15221
1342,"of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only",Pride and Prejudice,15222
1342,"were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent",Pride and Prejudice,15223
1342,on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much,Pride and Prejudice,15224
1342,"pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent",Pride and Prejudice,15225
1342,"love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a",Pride and Prejudice,15226
1342,"sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be",Pride and Prejudice,15227
1342,"exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,",Pride and Prejudice,15228
1342,she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how,Pride and Prejudice,15229
1342,"far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would",Pride and Prejudice,15230
1342,"be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her",Pride and Prejudice,15231

1342,"genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind",Pride and Prejudice,15275
1342,of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the,Pride and Prejudice,15276

1342,finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many,Pride and Prejudice,15298
1342,a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been,Pride and Prejudice,15299
1342,"given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole",Pride and Prejudice,15300
1342,"party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the",Pride and Prejudice,15301
1342,"beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected",Pride and Prejudice,15302
1342,them round the table.,Pride and Prejudice,15303
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15304
1342,"While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether",Pride and Prejudice,15305
1342,"she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the",Pride and Prejudice,15306
1342,"feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but",Pride and Prejudice,15307
1342,"a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to",Pride and Prejudice,15308
1342,regret that he came.,Pride and Prejudice,15309
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15310
1342,"He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other",Pride and Prejudice,15311
1342,"gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him",Pride and Prejudice,15312
1342,only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to,Pride and Prejudice,15313
1342,Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely,Pride and Prejudice,15314
1342,resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more,Pride and Prejudice,15315
1342,"necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she",Pride and Prejudice,15316
1342,"saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,",Pride and Prejudice,15317
1342,and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour,Pride and Prejudice,15318
1342,when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive,Pride and Prejudice,15319
1342,"curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the",Pride and Prejudice,15320
1342,smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its,Pride and Prejudice,15321
1342,"objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions",Pride and Prejudice,15322
1342,"to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's",Pride and Prejudice,15323
1342,"entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he",Pride and Prejudice,15324
1342,"was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded",Pride and Prejudice,15325
1342,"as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss",Pride and Prejudice,15326
1342,"Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the",Pride and Prejudice,15327
1342,"first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:",Pride and Prejudice,15328
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15329
1342,"""Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?",Pride and Prejudice,15330

1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15332
1342,In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice,15333
1342,instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the,Pride and Prejudice,15334
1342,various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;,Pride and Prejudice,15335
1342,"but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she",Pride and Prejudice,15336
1342,presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While,Pride and Prejudice,15337
1342,"she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened",Pride and Prejudice,15338
1342,"complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with",Pride and Prejudice,15339
1342,"confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what",Pride and Prejudice,15340
1342,"pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would",Pride and Prejudice,15341
1342,have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose,Pride and Prejudice,15342
1342,Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed,Pride and Prejudice,15343
1342,"her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in",Pride and Prejudice,15344
1342,"Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies",Pride and Prejudice,15345
1342,and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected,Pride and Prejudice,15346
1342,with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's,Pride and Prejudice,15347
1342,"meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy",Pride and Prejudice,15348
1342,"was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections",Pride and Prejudice,15349
1342,"her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very",Pride and Prejudice,15350
1342,"wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming",Pride and Prejudice,15351
1342,"hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without",Pride and Prejudice,15352
1342,meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss,Pride and Prejudice,15353
1342,"Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern",Pride and Prejudice,15354
1342,for the welfare of his friend.,Pride and Prejudice,15355
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15356
1342,"Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and",Pride and Prejudice,15357
1342,"as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to",Pride and Prejudice,15358
1342,"Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able",Pride and Prejudice,15359
1342,"to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely",Pride and Prejudice,15360
1342,"recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which",Pride and Prejudice,15361
1342,had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have,Pride and Prejudice,15362
1342,fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.,Pride and Prejudice,15363
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15364
1342,Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above,Pride and Prejudice,15365
1342,mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss,Pride and Prejudice,15366
1342,"Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,",Pride and Prejudice,15367
1342,"behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's",Pride and Prejudice,15368
1342,recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not,Pride and Prejudice,15369
1342,err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana,Pride and Prejudice,15370
1342,without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When,Pride and Prejudice,15371
1342,"Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to",Pride and Prejudice,15372
1342,him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.,Pride and Prejudice,15373
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15374
1342,"""How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,"" she",Pride and Prejudice,15375

1342,summer.,Pride and Prejudice,15383

1342,"""For my own part,"" she rejoined, ""I must confess that I never could",Pride and Prejudice,15385
1342,see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no,Pride and Prejudice,15386
1342,brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose,Pride and Prejudice,15387
1342,wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are,Pride and Prejudice,15388
1342,"tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,",Pride and Prejudice,15389
1342,"which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything",Pride and Prejudice,15390
1342,"extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do",Pride and Prejudice,15391
1342,not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency,Pride and Prejudice,15392

1342,"receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that",Pride and Prejudice,15433

1342,"little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;",Pride and Prejudice,15441
1342,"but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident",Pride and Prejudice,15442

1342,most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be,Pride and Prejudice,15446
1342,assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.,Pride and Prejudice,15447

1342,"surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am",Pride and Prejudice,15451
1342,"very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing",Pride and Prejudice,15452
1342,"to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.",Pride and Prejudice,15453
1342,"Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step",Pride and Prejudice,15454
1342,(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is,Pride and Prejudice,15455

1342,"twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at",Pride and Prejudice,15460
1342,"eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have",Pride and Prejudice,15461
1342,passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect,Pride and Prejudice,15462

1342,head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest,Pride and Prejudice,15475
1342,"Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,",Pride and Prejudice,15476

1342,"taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone",Pride and Prejudice,15479
1342,"to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the",Pride and Prejudice,15480
1342,"day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short",Pride and Prejudice,15481
1342,letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna,Pride and Prejudice,15482
1342,"Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.",Pride and Prejudice,15483
1342,"never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was",Pride and Prejudice,15484
1342,"repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.",Pride and Prejudice,15485
1342,"intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,",Pride and Prejudice,15486
1342,"but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney",Pride and Prejudice,15487
1342,"coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that",Pride and Prejudice,15488
1342,"is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.",Pride and Prejudice,15489
1342,I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that,Pride and Prejudice,15490
1342,"side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing",Pride and Prejudice,15491
1342,"them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but",Pride and Prejudice,15492
1342,without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With,Pride and Prejudice,15493
1342,"the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions",Pride and Prejudice,15494
1342,to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved,Pride and Prejudice,15495
1342,"for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our",Pride and Prejudice,15496
1342,"distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the",Pride and Prejudice,15497
1342,"worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make",Pride and Prejudice,15498
1342,it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue,Pride and Prejudice,15499
1342,their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a,Pride and Prejudice,15500
1342,"young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose",Pride and Prejudice,15501
1342,"her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that",Pride and Prejudice,15502
1342,Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his,Pride and Prejudice,15503
1342,"head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to",Pride and Prejudice,15504
1342,"be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she",Pride and Prejudice,15505
1342,"exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And",Pride and Prejudice,15506
1342,"as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has",Pride and Prejudice,15507
1342,anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of,Pride and Prejudice,15508
1342,"confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you",Pride and Prejudice,15509
1342,"have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the",Pride and Prejudice,15510
1342,"first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not",Pride and Prejudice,15511
1342,"so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I",Pride and Prejudice,15512
1342,take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but,Pride and Prejudice,15513
1342,circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to,Pride and Prejudice,15514
1342,"come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,",Pride and Prejudice,15515
1342,"that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something",Pride and Prejudice,15516
1342,more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel,Pride and Prejudice,15517
1342,"Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure",Pride and Prejudice,15518
1342,I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any,Pride and Prejudice,15519

1342,"be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my",Pride and Prejudice,15521

1342,"somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,",Pride and Prejudice,15642
1342,"and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other",Pride and Prejudice,15643
1342,"less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him",Pride and Prejudice,15644
1342,go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must,Pride and Prejudice,15645
1342,"produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched",Pride and Prejudice,15646
1342,"business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained",Pride and Prejudice,15647
1342,"a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,",Pride and Prejudice,15648
1342,could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least,Pride and Prejudice,15649
1342,of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first,Pride and Prejudice,15650

1342,Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry,Pride and Prejudice,15652
1342,for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared,Pride and Prejudice,15653
1342,incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment,Pride and Prejudice,15654
1342,as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose,Pride and Prejudice,15655
1342,Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention,Pride and Prejudice,15656
1342,"of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue",Pride and Prejudice,15657
1342,nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.,Pride and Prejudice,15658
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,15659
1342,"She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that",Pride and Prejudice,15660
1342,Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia,Pride and Prejudice,15661
1342,wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one,Pride and Prejudice,15662
1342,"officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions",Pride and Prejudice,15663
1342,raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been,Pride and Prejudice,15664

1342,"could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost",Pride and Prejudice,15673

1342,"and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's",Pride and Prejudice,15675
1342,account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them,Pride and Prejudice,15676
1342,"instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their",Pride and Prejudice,15677
1342,"summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript",Pride and Prejudice,15678
1342,of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a,Pride and Prejudice,15679

1342,"assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked",Pride and Prejudice,15683
1342,"him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,",Pride and Prejudice,15684
1342,everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to,Pride and Prejudice,15685
1342,"be off as soon as possible. ""But what is to be done about Pemberley?""",Pride and Prejudice,15686

1342,"for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think",Pride and Prejudice,16241

1342,"the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived",Pride and Prejudice,16634
1342,him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that,Pride and Prejudice,16635
1342,"respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever",Pride and Prejudice,16636

1342,"useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join",Pride and Prejudice,16647
1342,"in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow",Pride and Prejudice,16648

1342,"would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then",Pride and Prejudice,16652
1342,"too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her",Pride and Prejudice,16653

1342,"regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet",Pride and Prejudice,16660
1342,could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In,Pride and Prejudice,16661
1342,"terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,",Pride and Prejudice,16662
1342,"though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect",Pride and Prejudice,16663
1342,"approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the",Pride and Prejudice,16664
1342,engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed,Pride and Prejudice,16665
1342,"that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would",Pride and Prejudice,16666
1342,be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present,Pride and Prejudice,16667

1342,"allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her",Pride and Prejudice,16670
1342,"through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within",Pride and Prejudice,16671
1342,that sum.,Pride and Prejudice,16672
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,16673
1342,"That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was",Pride and Prejudice,16674
1342,another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as,Pride and Prejudice,16675
1342,little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports,Pride and Prejudice,16676
1342,"of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he",Pride and Prejudice,16677
1342,naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon,Pride and Prejudice,16678
1342,"dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick",Pride and Prejudice,16679
1342,in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he,Pride and Prejudice,16680
1342,"was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any",Pride and Prejudice,16681
1342,message to her.,Pride and Prejudice,16682
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,16683
1342,"The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate",Pride and Prejudice,16684
1342,speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent,Pride and Prejudice,16685
1342,"philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage",Pride and Prejudice,16686
1342,"of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the",Pride and Prejudice,16687
1342,"happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant",Pride and Prejudice,16688
1342,farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the,Pride and Prejudice,16689
1342,good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from,Pride and Prejudice,16690
1342,all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit,Pride and Prejudice,16691

1342,was considered certain.,Pride and Prejudice,16693
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,16694
1342,It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this,Pride and Prejudice,16695
1342,"happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in",Pride and Prejudice,16696
1342,spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her,Pride and Prejudice,16697
1342,"triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object",Pride and Prejudice,16698
1342,"of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of",Pride and Prejudice,16699
1342,"accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those",Pride and Prejudice,16700
1342,"attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and",Pride and Prejudice,16701
1342,servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a,Pride and Prejudice,16702
1342,"proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering",Pride and Prejudice,16703
1342,"what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and",Pride and Prejudice,16704
1342,importance.,Pride and Prejudice,16705

1342,"great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is",Pride and Prejudice,16708
1342,too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for,Pride and Prejudice,16709
1342,"Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.""",Pride and Prejudice,16710
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,16711
1342,Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the,Pride and Prejudice,16712

1342,"Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and",Pride and Prejudice,16714
1342,"daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this",Pride and Prejudice,16715
1342,neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the,Pride and Prejudice,16716
1342,"impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.""",Pride and Prejudice,16717
1342,"",Pride and Prejudice,16718
1342,A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It,Pride and Prejudice,16719
1342,"soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,",Pride and Prejudice,16720
1342,that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his,Pride and Prejudice,16721
1342,daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of,Pride and Prejudice,16722
1342,affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend,Pride and Prejudice,16723
1342,it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable,Pride and Prejudice,16724
1342,resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her,Pride and Prejudice,16725
1342,"marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe",Pride and Prejudice,16726
1342,possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new,Pride and Prejudice,16727
1342,"clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of",Pride and Prejudice,16728

1342,"Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of",Pride and Prejudice,16732
1342,"the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for",Pride and Prejudice,16733
1342,her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the,Pride and Prejudice,16734
1342,"proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its",Pride and Prejudice,16735

1342,few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;,Pride and Prejudice,16740
1342,"but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's",Pride and Prejudice,16741
1342,"frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear",Pride and Prejudice,16742
1342,"of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,",Pride and Prejudice,16743
1342,there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been,Pride and Prejudice,16744
1342,"concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that",Pride and Prejudice,16745
1342,"Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other",Pride and Prejudice,16746
1342,"objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the",Pride and Prejudice,16747

1342,"longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there",Pride and Prejudice,16755
1342,seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that,Pride and Prejudice,16756
1342,"she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they",Pride and Prejudice,16757
1342,should meet.,Pride and Prejudice,16758

1342,"disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and",Pride and Prejudice,16767
1342,"temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It",Pride and Prejudice,16768
1342,was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease,Pride and Prejudice,16769

1342,on quitting the militia.,Pride and Prejudice,16791

1342,"ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It",Pride and Prejudice,16799
1342,is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He,Pride and Prejudice,16800
1342,"promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each",Pride and Prejudice,16801
1342,"have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have",Pride and Prejudice,16802
1342,"written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,",Pride and Prejudice,16803

1342,that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven,Pride and Prejudice,16991

1342,himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to,Pride and Prejudice,17100
1342,make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide,Pride and Prejudice,17101
